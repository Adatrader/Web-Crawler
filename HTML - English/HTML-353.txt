It was a principal location of the [[Seminole Wars]] against the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], and racial segregation after the [[American Civil War]].

Today, Florida is distinctive for its large [[Cuba]]n expatriate community and high population growth, as well as for its increasing environmental issues.

==History==

{{Main|History of Florida}}

By the 16th century, the earliest time for which there is a historical record, major [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] groups included the [[Apalachee]] of the [[Florida Panhandle]], the [[Timucua]] of northern and central Florida, the [[Ais people|Ais]] of the central Atlantic coast, the [[Tocobaga]] of the [[Tampa Bay]] area, the [[Calusa]] of southwest Florida and the [[Tequesta]] of the southeastern coast.

Florida was the first region of the [[continental United States]] to be visited and settled by Europeans. The earliest known European explorers came with the Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Juan Ponce de Le√≥n]]. Ponce de Le√≥n spotted and landed on the peninsula on April 2, 1513. He named it ''[[Spanish Florida|La Florida]]'' in recognition of the verdant landscape and because it was the [[Easter]] season, which the Spaniards called ''[[Pascua Florida]]'' (Festival of Flowers). The following day they came ashore to seek information and take possession of this new land.&lt;ref name="Steigman2005">{{cite book|author=Jonathan D.

In May 1539, Conquistador [[Hernando de Soto]] skirted the coast of Florida, searching for a deep harbor to land. He described a thick wall of red mangroves spread mile after mile, some reaching as high as {{convert|70|ft}}, with intertwined and elevated roots making landing difficult.&lt;ref>Davidson, James West.

In 1559, Don [[Trist√°n de Luna y Arellano]] established a settlement at present-day [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]], making it the first attempted settlement in Florida, but it was mostly abandoned by 1561.

In 1565, the settlement of [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] (San Agust√≠n) was established under the leadership of admiral and governor [[Pedro Men√©ndez de Avil√©s]], creating what would become one of the oldest, continuously-occupied European settlements in the continental U.S. and establishing the first generation of Floridanos and the [[List of colonial governors of Florida|Government of Florida]].&lt;ref>{{cite web|url=http://losfloridanos.org/|title=Los Floridanos|website=Los Floridanos}}&lt;/ref> &lt;!-- Add text re significance of St. Augustine --> Spain maintained strategic control over the region by [[Spanish missions in Florida|converting the local tribes]] to Christianity.

Some Spanish married or had unions with Pensacola, Creek or [[List of ethnic groups of Africa|African]] women, both slave and free, and their descendants created a mixed-race population of [[mestizo]]s and [[mulatto]]s. The Spanish encouraged slaves from the southern British colonies to come to Florida as a refuge, promising freedom in exchange for conversion to [[Catholicism]]. King [[Charles II of Spain]] issued a royal proclamation freeing all slaves who fled to Spanish Florida and accepted conversion and baptism. Most went to the area around [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]], but escaped slaves also reached Pensacola. St. Augustine had mustered an all-black militia unit defending Spain as early as 1683.&lt;ref>{{citation|url=https://www.nps.gov/articles/sanctuary-in-the-spanish-empire.htm|title=Sanctuary in the Spanish Empire: An African American officer earns freedom in Florida|author=Gene Allen Smith, Texas Christian University|publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref>

The geographical area of [[Spanish Florida|Florida]] diminished with the establishment of English settlements to the north and French claims to the west. The English attacked St. Augustine, burning the city and its cathedral to the ground several times. Spain built the [[Castillo de San Marcos]] in 1672 and [[Fort Matanzas]] in 1742 to defend Florida's capital city from attacks, and to maintain its strategic position in the defense of the [[Captaincy General of Cuba]] and the [[Spanish West Indies]].

Florida attracted numerous Africans and African Americans from adjacent British colonies who sought freedom from slavery. In 1738, Governor [[Manuel de Montiano]] established [[Fort Mose Historic State Park|Fort Gracia Real de Santa Teresa de Mose]] near St. Augustine, a fortified town for escaped slaves to whom Montiano granted citizenship and freedom in return for their service in the Florida militia, and which became the first free black settlement legally sanctioned in North America.&lt;ref name=precursor>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/underground/fl2.htm|title=Aboard the Underground Railroad‚ÄîFort Mose Site|first=Sarah Dillard|last=Pope|website=Nps.gov}}&lt;/ref>&lt;ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fortmose.org/|title=Fort Mose Historical Society|access-date=July 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref>

In [[Timeline of Florida History|1763]], Spain traded Florida to the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] for control of [[Havana]], Cuba, which [[Battle of Havana (1762)|had been captured]] by the British during the [[Seven Years' War]]. It was part of a large expansion of British territory following [[Great Britain in the Seven Years' War|their victory in the Seven Years' War]].

[[File:West Florida Map 1767.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.4|[[East Florida]] and [[West Florida]] in British period (1763‚Äì1783)]]

The British divided and consolidated the Florida provinces (''Las Floridas'') into [[British East Florida|East Florida]] and [[British West Florida|West Florida]], a division the Spanish government kept after the brief British period.&lt;ref>''A History of Florida''. Caroline Mays Brevard, Henry Eastman Bennett p. 77&lt;/ref> The British government gave land grants to officers and soldiers who had fought in the [[French and Indian War]] in order to encourage settlement. In order to induce settlers to move to Florida, reports of its natural wealth were published in England. A large number of British settlers who were described as being "energetic and of good character" moved to Florida, mostly coming from [[South Carolina]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and England. There was also a group of settlers who came from the colony of [[Bermuda]]. This would be the first permanent English-speaking population in what is now [[Duval County, Florida|Duval County]], [[Baker County, Florida|Baker County]], [[St. Johns County, Florida|St. Johns County]] and [[Nassau County, Florida|Nassau County]]. The British built good public roads and introduced the cultivation of sugar cane, indigo and fruits as well as the export of lumber.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA">''A History of Florida''. Caroline Mays Brevard, Henry Eastman Bennett&lt;/ref>&lt;ref name="ReferenceB">''The Land Policy in British East Florida''. [[C. L. Mowat|Charles L. Mowat]], 1940&lt;/ref>

The British governors were directed to call general assemblies as soon as possible in order to make laws for the Floridas, and in the meantime they were, with the advice of councils, to establish courts. This was the first introduction of the English-derived legal system which Florida still has today, including [[Jury trial|trial by jury]], [[habeas corpus]] and county-based government.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/>&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/> Neither East Florida nor West Florida sent any representatives to Philadelphia to draft the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].

Defense of Florida's northern border with the United States was minor during the second Spanish period. The region became a haven for escaped slaves and a base for Indian attacks against U.S. territories, and the U.S. pressed Spain for reform.

Americans of [[English-American|English descent]] and Americans of [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scots-Irish descent]] began moving into northern Florida from the backwoods of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[South Carolina]]. Though technically not allowed by the Spanish authorities and the Floridan government, they were never able to effectively police the border region and the backwoods settlers from the United States would continue to immigrate into Florida unchecked. These migrants, mixing with the already present British settlers who had remained in Florida since the British period, would be the progenitors of the population known as [[Florida Cracker]]s.&lt;ref>Ste Claire, Dana (2006). ''Cracker: Cracker Culture in Florida History''. University Press of Florida. {{ISBN|978-0-8130-3028-9}}&lt;/ref>

These American settlers established a permanent foothold in the area and ignored Spanish authorities. The British settlers who had remained also resented Spanish rule, leading to a rebellion in 1810 and the establishment for ninety days of the so-called Free and Independent Republic of [[West Florida]] on September 23. After meetings beginning in June, rebels overcame the garrison at [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]] (now in [[Louisiana]]), and unfurled the flag of the new republic: a single white star on a blue field. This flag would later become known as the "[[Bonnie Blue Flag]]".

In 1810, parts of West Florida were annexed by proclamation of President [[James Madison]], who claimed the region as part of the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. These parts were incorporated into the newly formed [[Territory of Orleans]]. The U.S. annexed the Mobile District of West Florida to the [[Mississippi Territory]] in 1812. Spain continued to dispute the area, though the United States gradually increased the area it occupied. In 1812, a group of settlers from Georgia, with de facto support from the U.S. federal government, attempted to overthrow the Floridan government in the province of East Florida. The settlers hoped to convince Floridans to join their cause and proclaim independence from Spain, but the settlers lost their tenuous support from the federal government and abandoned their cause by 1813.&lt;ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.floridamemory.com/collections/constitution/|title=Florida's Early Constitutions‚ÄîFlorida Memory|access-date=July 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref>

[[Seminole]]s based in [[East Florida]] began raiding Georgia settlements, and offering havens for runaway slaves. The [[United States Army]] led increasingly frequent incursions into Spanish territory, including the 1817‚Äì1818 campaign against the Seminole Indians by [[Andrew Jackson]] that became known as the [[First Seminole War]]. The United States now effectively controlled East Florida. Control was necessary according to Secretary of State [[John Quincy Adams]] because Florida had become "a derelict open to the occupancy of every enemy, civilized or savage, of the United States, and serving no other earthly purpose than as a post of annoyance to them."&lt;ref>Alexander Deconde, ''A History of American Foreign Policy'' (1963) p. 127&lt;/ref>

Florida had become a burden to Spain, which could not afford to send settlers or garrisons. Madrid therefore decided to cede the territory to the United States through the [[Adams‚ÄìOn√≠s Treaty]], which took effect in 1821.&lt;ref>{{cite book|last=Tebeau | first=Charlton W. | authorlink=Charlton W.

By the early 1800s, [[Indian removal]] was a significant issue throughout the southeastern U.S. and also in Florida. In 1830, the U.S. Congress passed the [[Indian Removal Act]] and as settlement increased, pressure grew on the U.S. government to remove the Indians from Florida. Seminoles offered sanctuary to blacks, and these became known as the [[Black Seminoles]], and clashes between whites and Indians grew with the influx of new settlers. In 1832, the [[Treaty of Payne's Landing]] promised to the Seminoles lands west of the Mississippi River if they agreed to leave Florida. Many Seminole left at this time.
[[File:The Call-Collins House, The Grove- Tallahassee, Florida (7157983334).jpg|thumb|The Historic Call-Collins House, the Grove, is an antebellum plantation house built in the 1840s in Tallahassee, Florida.]]
Some Seminoles remained, and the U.S. Army arrived in Florida, leading to the [[Second Seminole War]] (1835‚Äì1842). Following the war, approximately 3,000 Seminole and 800 Black Seminole were removed to [[Indian Territory]]. A few hundred Seminole remained in Florida in the [[Everglades]].

On March 3, 1845, only one day before the end of President [[John Tyler]]'s term in office, Florida became the 27th state,&lt;ref>{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&amp;fileName=005/llsl005.db&amp;recNum=779|title=A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774‚Äì1875|website=loc.gov|access-date=July 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref> admitted as a [[slave state]] and no longer a sanctuary for runaway slaves.

As European settlers continued to encroach on Seminole lands, the United States intervened to move the remaining Seminoles to the West. The [[Third Seminole War]] (1855‚Äì58) resulted in the [[Trail of Tears|forced removal]] of most of the remaining Seminoles, although hundreds of Seminole Indians remained in the Everglades.&lt;ref>Tindall, George Brown, and David Emory Shi.

American settlers began to establish cotton [[plantations in the American South|plantations]] in north Florida, which required numerous laborers, which they supplied by buying slaves in the domestic market. By 1860, Florida had only 140,424 people, of whom 44% were enslaved. There were fewer than 1,000 free [[free black|African Americans]] before the American Civil War.&lt;ref>[http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state.php Historical Census Browser, Retrieved October 31, 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823030234/http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state.php |date=August 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref>

On January 10, 1861, nearly all delegates in the Florida Legislature approved an ordinance of secession,&lt;ref>{{cite web |title=Ordinance of Secession, 1861 |url=https://www.floridamemory.com/exhibits/floridahighlights/secession/ |website=Florida Memory |publisher=State Library &amp; Archives of Florida |accessdate=October 22, 2019}}&lt;/ref>&lt;ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americaslibrary.gov/jb/civil/jb_civil_florida_1.html|title=Florida Seceded!

The Confederacy received little help from Florida; the 15,000 men it offered were generally sent elsewhere. Instead of men and manufactured goods, Florida did provide salt and, more importantly, beef to feed the Confederate armies. This was particularly important after 1864, when the Confederacy lost control of the Mississippi River, thereby losing access to Texas beef.&lt;ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.floridamemory.com/onlineclassroom/floridacivilwar/|title=Florida in the Civil War|first=State Library and Archives of|last=Florida|website=Florida Memory|accessdate=May 19, 2019}}&lt;/ref>&lt;ref>Taylor, R.

Following the American Civil War, Florida's [[United States Congress|congressional]] representation was restored on June 25, 1868, albeit forcefully after [[Radical Reconstruction]] and the installation of unelected government officials under the final authority of federal military commanders. After the [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction]] period ended in 1876, white Democrats regained power in the state legislature. In 1885, they created a new constitution, followed by statutes through 1889 that [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised]] most blacks and many poor whites.&lt;ref name="Hewitt2001">{{cite book|author=Nancy A.

In the pre-automobile era, railroads played a key role in the state's development, particularly in coastal areas. In 1883, the [[Pensacola and Atlantic Railroad]] connected Pensacola and the rest of the [[Florida Panhandle|Panhandle]] to the rest of the state. In 1884 the [[South Florida Railroad]] (later absorbed by [[Atlantic Coast Line Railroad]]) opened full service to [[Tampa]]. In 1894 the [[Florida East Coast Railway]] reached [[West Palm Beach]]; in 1896 it reached [[Biscayne Bay]] near [[Miami]]. Numerous other railroads were built all over the interior of the state.

Until the mid-20th century, Florida was the least populous state in the [[southern United States]]. In 1900, its population was only 528,542, of whom nearly 44% were African American, the same proportion as before the Civil War.&lt;ref>Historical Census Browser, 1900 Federal Census, University of Virginia [http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state/php]{{Dead link|date=April 2010}}.

Historically, Florida's economy has been based primarily upon agricultural products such as cattle, sugar cane, citrus fruits, tomatoes, and strawberries.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}

In 1925, the [[Seaboard Air Line]] broke the FEC's southeast Florida monopoly and extended its freight and passenger service to West Palm Beach; two years later it extended passenger service to Miami.

Economic prosperity in the 1920s stimulated tourism to Florida and related development of hotels and resort communities. Combined with its sudden elevation in profile was the [[Florida land boom of the 1920s]], which brought a brief period of intense land development. Devastating hurricanes in [[1926 Miami hurricane|1926]] and [[1928 Okeechobee hurricane|1928]], followed by the [[Great Depression]], brought that period to a halt.
Florida's economy did not fully recover until the military buildup for World War{{nbsp}}II.

In 1939, Florida was described as "still very largely an empty State."&lt;ref>{{cite book

|page=7}}&lt;/ref> Subsequently, the growing availability of [[air conditioning]], the climate, and a low cost of living made the state a haven. Migration from the [[Rust Belt]] and the Northeast sharply increased Florida's population after 1945. In the 1960s, many refugees from Cuba fleeing [[Fidel Castro]]'s communist regime arrived in Miami at the [[Freedom Tower (Miami)|Freedom Tower]], where the federal government used the facility to process, document and provide medical and dental services for the newcomers. As a result, the Freedom Tower was also called the "Ellis Island of the South."&lt;ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/american_latino_heritage/freedom_tower.html|title=Freedom Tower‚ÄîAmerican Latino Heritage: A Discover Our Shared Heritage Travel Itinerary|website=Nps.gov}}&lt;/ref> In recent decades, more migrants have come for the jobs in a developing economy.

With a population of more than 18 million, according to the 2010 census, Florida is the most populous state in the southeastern United States and the third-most populous in the United States.&lt;ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/florida-is-now-officially-the-third-most-populous-state-6554486|title=Florida Is Now Officially the Third Most Populous State|first=Kyle|last=Munzenrieder|date=December 23, 2014|website=Miaminewtimes.com}}&lt;/ref> The population of Florida has boomed in recent years with the state being the recipient of the largest number of out-of-state movers in the country as of 2019.&lt;ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/florida-population-boom-taxes|title=Florida to see population boom over coming years as SALT deductions remain capped|first=Brittany De|last=Lea|date=August 9, 2019|website=FOXBusiness}}&lt;/ref> Florida's growth has been widespread, as cities throughout the state have grown since 2010.&lt;ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/adammillsap/2018/06/06/floridas-population-is-booming-but-should-we-worry-about-income-growth/|title=Florida's Population Is Booming--But Should We Worry About Income Growth?|first=Adam|last=Millsap|website=Forbes}}&lt;/ref>

After [[Hurricane Maria]] devastated [[Puerto Rico]] in September 2017, a large population of Puerto Ricans began moving to Florida to escape the widespread destruction. Hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans arrived in Florida after Maria dissipated, with nearly half of them arriving in Orlando and large populations also moving to Tampa, Fort Lauderdale, and West Palm Beach.&lt;ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/us/puerto-ricans-orlando.html|title=A Great Migration From Puerto Rico Is Set to Transform Orlando|date=November 17, 2017|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref>

Much of Florida is on a peninsula between the Gulf of Mexico, the Atlantic Ocean and the [[Straits of Florida]]. Spanning two [[time zone]]s, it extends to the northwest into a [[Salient (geography)|panhandle]], extending along the northern Gulf of Mexico. It is bordered on the north by [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[Alabama]], and on the west, at the end of the panhandle, by Alabama. It is the only state that borders both the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. Florida also is the southernmost of the 48 contiguous states, [[Hawaii]] being the only one reaching farther south. Florida is west of [[The Bahamas]] and {{convert|90|mi}} north of [[Cuba]]. Florida is one of the largest states east of the [[Mississippi River]], and only [[Alaska]] and [[Michigan]] are larger in water area. The water boundary is {{convert|3|nmi|mi km}} offshore in the Atlantic Ocean&lt;ref name="NOAA">{{cite web |url=http://coastalmanagement.noaa.gov/mystate/docs/StateCZBoundaries.pdf |title=State Coastal Zone Boundaries |author= Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management |publisher = National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration |date=July 1, 2011 |access-date=October 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref> and {{convert|9|nmi|mi km}} offshore in the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;ref name="NOAA"/>

[[File:Spalmetto2.JPG|thumb|The state tree, [[Sabal palmetto]], flourishes in Florida's overall warm climate.]]

The climate of Florida is tempered somewhat by the fact that no part of the state is distant from the ocean. North of [[Lake Okeechobee]], the prevalent climate is [[humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]] ([[K√∂ppen climate classification|K√∂ppen]]: ''Cfa''), while areas south of the lake (including the [[Florida Keys]]) have a true [[tropical climate]] (K√∂ppen: ''Aw'').&lt;ref name="Ritter">{{cite web |url=http://www.uwsp.edu/geO/faculty/ritter/geog101/textbook/climate_systems/climate_classification.html |title=Wet/Dry Tropical Climate |author=Ritter, Michael |publisher=University of Wisconsin, Stevens Point |access-date=July 18, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124064306/http://www.uwsp.edu/geo/faculty/ritter/geog101/textbook/climate_systems/climate_classification.html |archivedate=November 24, 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref> Mean high temperatures for late July are primarily in the low 90s Fahrenheit (32‚Äì34&amp;nbsp;¬∞C). Mean low temperatures for early to mid January range from the low 40s Fahrenheit (4‚Äì7&amp;nbsp;¬∞C) in north Florida to above {{convert|60|¬∞F|0}} from Miami on southward. With an average daily temperature of {{convert|70.7|¬∞F|1}}, it is the warmest state in the U.S.&lt;ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.currentresults.com/Weather/US/average-annual-state-temperatures.php|title=Average Annual Temperature for Each US State|publisher=Current Results Nexus|access-date=August 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref>&lt;ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.currentresults.com/Weather-Extremes/US/hottest-states.php|title=Hottest States in the US‚ÄîCurrent Results|website=Currentresults.com}}&lt;/ref>

In the summer, high temperatures in the state seldom exceed 100&amp;nbsp;¬∞F (38&amp;nbsp;¬∞C). Several record cold maxima have been in the 30s ¬∞F (‚àí1 to 4&amp;nbsp;¬∞C) and record lows have been in the 10s (‚àí12 to ‚àí7&amp;nbsp;¬∞C). These temperatures normally extend at most a few days at a time in the northern and central parts of Florida.

Florida is mostly [[Christians|Christian]], although there is a large [[irreligious]] and relatively significant [[Jewish]] community. [[Protestantism|Protestants]] account for almost half of the population, but the [[Catholic Church]] is the largest single denomination in the state mainly due to its large [[Hispanic]] population and other groups like [[Haitians]]. Protestants are very diverse, although [[Baptists]], [[Methodists]], [[Pentecostals]] and [[nondenominational Protestants]] are the largest groups. There is also a sizable [[American Jews|Jewish]] community in [[South Florida]]. This is the largest Jewish population in the [[Southern United States|southern U.S.]] and the third-largest in the U.S. behind those of [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[California]].&lt;ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/US-Israel/usjewpop.html |title=Jewish Population of the United States, by State (2011) |encyclopedia=Jewish Virtual Library |access-date=September 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref>

The basic structure, duties, function, and operations of the government of the State of Florida are defined and established by the [[Florida Constitution]], which establishes the basic law of the state and guarantees various rights and freedoms of the people. The state government consists of three separate branches: judicial, executive, and legislative. The legislature enacts bills, which, if signed by the [[Governor of Florida|governor]], become [[Florida Statutes|law]].

The [[Florida Legislature]] comprises the [[Florida Senate]], which has 40 members, and the [[Florida House of Representatives]], which has 120 members. The current governor of Florida is [[Ron DeSantis]].
The [[Florida Supreme Court]] consists of a chief justice and six justices.

Florida has 67 [[County (United States)|counties]]. Some reference materials may show only 66 because [[Duval County, Florida|Duval County]] is consolidated with the [[City of Jacksonville]]. There are 379 cities in Florida (out of 411) that report regularly to the Florida Department of Revenue, but there are other incorporated municipalities that do not. The state government's primary revenue source is sales tax. Florida does not impose a personal [[income tax]]. The primary revenue source for cities and counties is property tax; unpaid taxes are subject to [[tax sale]]s, which are held (at the county level) in May and (due to the extensive use of online bidding sites) are highly popular.

There were 800 [[Federal Corrupt Practices Act|federal corruption]] convictions from 1988 to 2007, more than any other state.&lt;ref>{{Cite news|title=Editorial:Culture of corruption |url=http://www.floridatoday.com/article/20110107/OPINION/110106021/Our-Views-Culture-of-corruption-Jan-7- |work=Florida Today |location=Melbourne, Florida |page=1A |date=January 7, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107202129/http://www.floridatoday.com/article/20110107/OPINION/110106021/Our-Views-Culture-of-corruption-Jan-7- |archivedate=January 7, 2014 }}&lt;/ref>

===Elections history===
{{further|Elections in Florida|Politics of Florida|Political party strength in Florida|United States presidential elections in Florida}}

From 1952 to 1964, most voters were registered Democrats, but the state voted for the Republican presidential candidate in every election except for [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]]. The following year, Congress passed and President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] signed the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], providing for oversight of state practices and enforcement of constitutional voting rights for African Americans and other minorities in order to prevent the discrimination and disenfranchisement which had excluded most of them for decades from the political process.

From the 1930s through much of the 1960s, Florida was essentially a one-party state dominated by white conservative Democrats, who together with other Democrats of the "[[Solid South]]", exercised considerable control in Congress. They have gained slightly less federal money from national programs than they have paid in taxes.&lt;ref>{{cite web|url=https://files.taxfoundation.org/legacy/docs/ftsbs-timeseries-20071016-.pdf|title=Alabama : Federal Taxes Paid vs. Federal Spending Received : 1981‚Äìpresent|website=Files.taxfoundation.org|accessdate=October 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref> Since the 1970s, conservative white voters in the state have largely shifted from the Democratic to the Republican Party. Though the majority of registered voters in Florida are Democrats.&lt;ref>{{cite web|url=http://dos.myflorida.com/elections/data-statistics/voter-registration-statistics/voter-registration-monthly-reports/voter-registration-current-by-county/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024133158/http://dos.myflorida.com/elections/data-statistics/voter-registration-statistics/voter-registration-monthly-reports/voter-registration-current-by-county/|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 24, 2016|title=Voter Registration‚ÄîCurrent by County‚ÄîDivision of Elections‚ÄîFlorida Department of State|date=October 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref> It continued to support Republican presidential candidates through 2004, except in [[1976 United States presidential election|1976]] and [[1996 United States presidential election|1996]], when the Democratic nominee was from "[[Southern United States|the South]]".

In the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]] and [[2012 United States presidential election|2012]] presidential elections, [[Barack Obama]] carried the state as a northern Democrat, attracting high voter turnout, especially among the young, Independents, and minority voters, of whom [[Hispanics]] comprise an increasingly large proportion. 2008 marked the first time since 1944, when [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] carried the state for the fourth time, that Florida was carried by a Northern Democrat for president.

The first post-[[Reconstruction era]] Republican elected to Congress from Florida was [[William C. Cramer]] in 1954 from Pinellas County on the Gulf Coast,&lt;ref name="William C. Cramer, 81, a Leader Of G.O.P. Resurgence in South"/> where demographic changes were underway. In this period, African Americans were still [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] by the state's constitution and discriminatory practices; in the 19th century, they had made up most of the Republican Party. Cramer built a different Republican Party in Florida, attracting local white conservatives and transplants from northern and midwestern states. In 1966, [[Claude R. Kirk, Jr.]] was elected as the first post-Reconstruction Republican governor, in an upset election.&lt;ref name="Claude Roy Kirk, Jr."/> In 1968, [[Edward J. Gurney]], also a white conservative, was elected as the state's first post-reconstruction Republican US senator.&lt;ref name="E. J. Gurney, 82, Senator Who Backed Nixon"/> In 1970, Democrats took the governorship and the open US Senate seat, and maintained dominance for years.

Since the mid-20th century, Florida has been considered a [[bellwether]], voting for 15 successful presidential candidates since 1952. During such period, it has voted for a losing candidate only twice.&lt;ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ask.com/question/what-is-a-bellwether-state |title=What Is a Bellwether State? |website=Ask.com |access-date=January 7, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107202837/http://www.ask.com/question/what-is-a-bellwether-state |archivedate=January 7, 2014}}{{unreliable source?|date=April 2019}}&lt;/ref>

In 1998, Democratic voters dominated areas of the state with a high percentage of racial minorities and transplanted white liberals from the northeastern United States, known colloquially as "snowbirds".&lt;ref name="The New York Times"/> [[South Florida]] and the [[Miami metropolitan area]] are dominated by both racial minorities and white liberals. Because of this, the area has consistently voted as one of the most Democratic areas of the state. The Daytona Beach area is similar demographically and the city of Orlando has a large Hispanic population, which has often favored Democrats. Republicans, made up mostly of white conservatives, have dominated throughout much of the rest of Florida, particularly in the more rural and suburban areas. This is characteristic of its voter base throughout the [[Deep South]].&lt;ref name="The New York Times" />

The fast-growing [[I-4 corridor]] area, which runs through [[Central Florida]] and connects the cities of [[Daytona Beach, Florida|Daytona Beach]], [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], and [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]]/[[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]], has had a fairly even breakdown of Republican and Democratic voters. The area is often seen as a merging point of the conservative northern portion of the state and the liberal southern portion, making it the biggest swing area in the state. Since the late 20th century, the voting results in this area, containing 40% of Florida voters, has often determined who will win the state in federal presidential elections.&lt;ref name="The Washington Times"/>

The Democratic Party has maintained an edge in voter registration, both statewide and in 40 of the 67 counties, including [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade]], [[Broward County, Florida|Broward]], and [[Palm Beach County, Florida|Palm Beach]] counties, the state's three most populous.&lt;ref name="Voter Registration by Party Affiliation and County"/>

====Elections of 2000 to present====
{{Main|United States presidential election in Florida, 2000}}

In 2000, [[George W. Bush]] won the [[2000 United States presidential election|U.S. Presidential election]] by a margin of 271‚Äì266 in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]].&lt;ref name="archives2000"/> Of the 271 electoral votes for Bush, 25 were cast by electors from Florida.&lt;ref name="archives1"/> The Florida results were contested and a recount was ordered by the court, with the results settled in a [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision, [[Bush v. Gore]].

Reapportionment following the [[2010 United States Census]] gave the state two more seats in the House of Representatives.&lt;ref name=CENSUS>Leary, Alex: [http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/national/article1141209.ece "Florida gains two U.S. House seats in Census"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224164152/http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/national/article1141209.ece |date=December 24, 2010 }}, ''St. Petersburg Times'', December 21, 2010&lt;/ref> The legislature's redistricting, announced in 2012, was quickly challenged in court, on the grounds that it had unfairly benefited Republican interests. In 2015, the Florida Supreme Court ruled on appeal that the congressional districts had to be redrawn because of the legislature's violation of the Fair District Amendments to the state constitution passed in 2010; it accepted a new map in early December 2015.

The political make-up of congressional and legislative districts has enabled Republicans to control the governorship and most statewide elective offices, and 17 of the state's 27 seats in the 2012 [[United States House of Representatives elections in Florida, 2012|House of Representatives]].&lt;ref>{{cite web|last=Pear|first=Robert|title=Elections 2012, State Results|url=http://elections.nytimes.com/2012/results/states/florida|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=April 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref> Florida has been listed as a [[swing state]] in Presidential elections since 1952, voting for the losing candidate only twice in that period of time.&lt;!---Nixon in 1960 and Bush in 1992.

In the closely contested [[2000 United States presidential election in Florida|2000 election]], the state played a pivotal role.&lt;ref name="archives2000"/>&lt;ref name="archives1"/>&lt;ref>''See'' [https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-949.ZPC.html ''Bush'' ''v''.

The Department of State shall certify as elected the presidential electors of the candidates for President and Vice President who receive the highest number of votes.")&lt;/ref> Out of more than 5.8&amp;nbsp;million votes for the two main contenders Bush and [[Al Gore]], around 500 votes separated the two candidates for the all-decisive Florida electoral votes that landed Bush the election win. Florida's [[felony disenfranchisement]] law is more severe than most European nations or other American states. A 2002 study in the ''[[American Sociological Review]]'' concluded that "if the state's 827,000 disenfranchised felons had voted at the same rate as other Floridians, Democratic candidate Al Gore would have won Florida‚Äîand the presidency‚Äîby more than 80,000 votes."&lt;ref name="restore">[https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/02/maryland-felon-voting/462000/ Matt Ford, "Restoring Voting Rights for Felons in Maryland"], ''The Atlantic'', February 9, 2016, accessed March 23, 2016&lt;/ref>

In 2008, delegates of both the [[Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008#GOP February 5 rule|Republican Florida primary election]] and [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008#Nullified primaries|Democratic Florida primary election]] were stripped of half of their votes when the conventions met in August due to violation of both parties' national rules.

In the 2010 elections, Republicans solidified their dominance statewide, by winning the governor's mansion, and maintaining firm majorities in both houses of the state legislature. They won four previously Democratic-held seats to create a 19‚Äì6 Republican-majority delegation representing Florida in the federal House of Representatives.

In 2010, more than 63% of state voters approved the initiated Amendments{{nbsp}}5 and{{nbsp}}6 to the state constitution, to ensure more fairness in districting. These have become known as the Fair District Amendments. As a result of the [[2010 United States Census]], Florida gained two House of Representative seats in 2012.&lt;ref name=CENSUS /> The legislature issued revised congressional districts in 2012, which were immediately challenged in court by supporters of the above amendments.

The court ruled in 2014, after lengthy testimony, that at least two districts had to be redrawn because of gerrymandering. After this was appealed, in July 2015 the Florida Supreme Court ruled that lawmakers had followed an illegal and unconstitutional process overly influenced by party operatives, and ruled that at least eight districts had to be redrawn. On December 2, 2015, a 5‚Äì2 majority of the Court accepted a new map of congressional districts, some of which was drawn by challengers. Their ruling affirmed the map previously approved by [[Leon County, Florida|Leon County]] Judge Terry Lewis, who had overseen the original trial. It particularly makes changes in South Florida. There are likely to be additional challenges to the map and districts.&lt;ref>[http://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article47576450.html Mary Ellen Klas, "Florida Supreme Court approves congressional map drawn by challengers"], ''Tampa Bay Times'', December 2, 2015, accessed December 11, 2016&lt;/ref>

According to [[The Sentencing Project]], the effect of Florida's felony disenfranchisement law is such that in 2014, "[m]ore than one in ten Floridians‚Äîand nearly one in four African-American Floridians‚Äîare [were] shut out of the polls because of felony convictions", although they had completed sentences and parole/probation requirements.&lt;ref>Brent Staples, "Florida Leads the Pack‚Äîin Felon Disenfranchisement", ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 7, 2014, accessed March 23, 2016&lt;/ref>

The state's [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] representation at the national level increased by one seat, but the overall state-wide composition was 16 Republicans to 11 Democrats. Floridians also voted 49.0% to 47.8% to elect [[Donald Trump]] over [[Hillary Clinton]] in the presidential election. With a 1.2% difference, this was the 5th closest presidential race that year, with only [[Wisconsin]], [[Michigan]], [[New Hampshire]] and [[Pennsylvania]] being closer.

In the [[2018 United States elections|2018 Midterm Elections]], the ratio of Republican to Democratic representation fell from 16:11 to 14:13. The Senate race between Democratic incumbent [[Senator]] [[Bill Nelson]] and former [[Governor]] [[Rick Scott]] was very close, with a 49.93% voting for the incumbent and 50.06% voting for the former governor. Republicans also held onto the governorship in a close race between Republican candidate [[Ron DeSantis]] and Democractic candidate [[Andrew Gillum]], with 49.6% voting for the DeSantis and 49.3% voting for Gillum.
