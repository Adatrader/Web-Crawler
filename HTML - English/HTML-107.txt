The name on the map applied to the lands of [[South America]], in honor of the Italian explorer [[Amerigo Vespucci]] ({{lang-la|Americus Vespucius}}).{{sfn|Sider|2007|p=226}} After returning from his expeditions, Vespucci first postulated that the [[West Indies]] did not represent Asia's eastern limit, as initially thought by Columbus, but instead were part of an entirely separate landmass thus far unknown to the Europeans.&lt;ref>{{cite web |last1=Szalay |first1=Jessie |title=Amerigo Vespucci: Facts, Biography &amp; Naming of America |url=https://www.livescience.com/42510-amerigo-vespucci.html |publisher=[[Live Science]] |accessdate=June 23, 2019 |date=September 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref> Then in 1538, the Flemish cartographer [[Gerardus Mercator]] used the name "America" on his map of the world, applying it to the entire [[Western Hemisphere]].&lt;ref name="Cohen">{{cite web|url=http://www.uhmc.sunysb.edu/surgery/america.html |title=The Naming of America: Fragments We've Shored Against Ourselves |author=Jonathan Cohen |accessdate=February 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref>

The first documentary evidence of the phrase "United States of America" is from a letter dated January 2, 1776, written by [[Stephen Moylan]], Esq., to [[George Washington]]'s [[aide-de-camp]] and Muster-Master General of the [[Continental Army]], [[Joseph Reed (politician)|Lt.

The second draft of the [[Articles of Confederation]], prepared by [[John Dickinson]] and completed by June 17, 1776, at the latest, declared "The name of this Confederation shall be the 'United States of America{{' "}}.{{sfn|Safire|2003|p=199}} The final version of the Articles sent to the states for ratification in late 1777 contains the sentence "The Stile of this Confederacy shall be 'The United States of America{{' "}}.{{sfn|Mostert|2005|p=18}} In June 1776, [[Thomas Jefferson]] wrote the phrase "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA" in all capitalized letters in the headline of his "original Rough draught" of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].{{sfn|Safire|2003|p=199}} This draft of the document did not surface until June 21, 1776, and it is unclear whether it was written before or after Dickinson used the term in his June 17 draft of the Articles of Confederation.{{sfn|Safire|2003|p=199}}

The short form "United States" is also standard. Other common forms are the "U.S.", the "USA", and "America". Colloquial names are the "U.S. of A." and, internationally, the "States". "[[Columbia (name)|Columbia]]", a name popular in poetry and songs of the late 18th century, derives its origin from [[Christopher Columbus]]; it appears in the name "[[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]]". Many landmarks and institutions in the Western Hemisphere bear his name, including the country of [[Colombia]].{{sfn|Brokenshire|1993|page=49}}

The phrase "United States" was originally plural, a description of a collection of independent states‚Äîe.g., "the United States are"‚Äîincluding in the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], ratified in 1865.{{sfn|Greg|1892|p=276}} The singular form‚Äîe.g., "the United States is"‚Äîbecame popular after the end of the American Civil War. The singular form is now standard; the plural form is retained in the idiom "these United States". The difference is more significant than usage; it is a difference between a collection of states and a unit.&lt;ref>G. H. Emerson, ''The Universalist Quarterly and General Review'', Vol. 28 (Jan. 1891), p. 49, quoted in {{cite web |url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002663.html |author=Zimmer, Benjamin |date=November 24, 2005 |title=Life in These, Uh, This United States |publisher=University of Pennsylvania |accessdate=January 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref>

A [[Citizenship of the United States|citizen of the United States]] is an "[[Americans|American]]". "United States", "American" and "U.S." refer to the country adjectivally ("American values", "U.S.&amp;nbsp;forces").

It has been generally accepted that the [[Prehistoric migration and settlement of the Americas from Asia|first inhabitants of North America]] migrated from [[Siberia]] by way of the [[Beringia|Bering land bridge]] and arrived at least 12,000 years ago; however, increasing evidence suggests an even earlier arrival.{{sfn|Erlandson|Rick|Vellanoweth|2008|p=19}}{{sfn|Savage|2011|page= 55}}{{sfn|Haviland|Walrath|Prins|2013|page=219}} After crossing the land bridge, the first Americans moved southward along the Pacific coast{{sfn|Fladmark|2017|pages= 55‚Äì69}} and through an interior ice-free corridor between the [[Cordilleran Ice Sheet|Cordilleran]] and [[Laurentide Ice Sheet|Laurentide]] ice sheets.{{sfn|Meltzer|2009|page= 129}} The [[Clovis culture]] appeared around 11,000 BC, and is considered to be an ancestor of most of the later indigenous cultures of the Americas.{{sfn|Waters|Stafford|2007|pages=1122‚Äì1126}} The Clovis culture was believed to represent the first human settlement of the Americas.{{sfn|Flannery|2015|pages=173‚Äì185}} Over the years, more and more evidence has advanced the idea of "pre-Clovis" cultures including tools dating back about 15,550 years ago. It is likely these represent the first of three major waves of migrations into North America.{{sfn|Gelo|2018|pagees=79-80}}

Over time, indigenous cultures in North America grew increasingly complex, and some, such as the [[pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] [[Mississippian culture]] in the southeast, developed advanced agriculture, grand architecture, and state-level societies.{{sfn|Lockard|2010|page= 315}} The Mississippian culture flourished in the south from 800 to 1600 AD, extending from the Mexican border down through Florida.{{sfn|Inghilleri|2016|page= 117}} Its city state [[Cahokia]] is considered the largest, most complex pre-Columbian [[archaeology|archaeological site]] in the modern-day United States.{{sfn|Martinez|Sage|Ono|2016|page= 4}} In the [[Four Corners]] region, [[Ancestral Puebloans]] culture developed as the culmination of centuries of agricultural experimentation, which produced greater dependence on farming.{{sfn|Fagan|2016|page=390}} Three [[UNESCO World Heritage Sites]] in the United States are credited to the Pueblos: [[Mesa Verde National Park]], [[Chaco Culture National Historical Park]], and [[Taos Pueblo]].{{sfn|Martinez|Bordeaux|2016|page=602}}{{sfn|Weiss|Jacobson|2000|page=180}} The earthworks constructed by Native Americans of the [[Poverty Point]] culture in northeastern [[Louisiana]] have also been designated a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage site]].

While estimating the original native population of North America at the time of European contact is difficult, an attempt was made in the early part of the twentieth century by [[James Mooney]] using historic records to estimate the indigenous population north of [[Mexico]] in 1600.{{sfn|Perdue|Green|2005|page=40}}{{sfn|Haines|Haines|Steckel|2000|page= 12}} In more recent years, [[Douglas H.

Dobyns]] believed the populations were much higher, suggesting 1,100,000 along the shores of the gulf of Mexico, 2,211,000 people living between [[Florida]] and [[Massachusetts]], 5,250,000 in the [[Mississippi Valley]] and tributaries and 697,000 people in the [[Florida peninsula]].{{sfn|Perdue|Green|2005|page=40}}{{sfn|Haines|Haines|Steckel|2000|page= 12}}

In the early days of colonization, many European settlers were subject to food shortages, disease, and attacks from Native Americans. Native Americans were also often at war with neighboring tribes and allied with Europeans in their [[colonial war]]s. At the same time, however, many natives and settlers came to depend on each other. Settlers traded for food and animal pelts, natives for guns, ammunition and other European wares.&lt;ref>[[#Ripper2008|Ripper, 2008]] p. 6&lt;/ref> Natives taught many settlers where, when and how to cultivate corn, beans, and squash.

With the advancement of European colonization in the territories of the contemporary United States, the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] were often [[American Indian Wars|conquered and displaced]].{{sfn|Joseph|2016|page=590}} The first Europeans to arrive in the territory of the modern United States were Spanish [[conquistador]]s such as [[Juan Ponce de Le√≥n]], who made his first visit to [[Spanish Florida|Florida]] in 1513; however, if [[unincorporated territories of the United States|unincorporated territories]] are accounted for, then credit would go to [[Christopher Columbus]] who landed in [[Puerto Rico]] on his [[Columbus's second voyage|1493 voyage]]. The Spanish set up the first settlements in Florida and New Mexico such as [[St. Augustine, Florida|Saint Augustine]]&lt;ref name="Saint Augustine">{{cite web |title=St. Augustine Florida, The Nation's Oldest City |url=http://staugustine.com/history/nations-oldest-city |website=staugustine.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref> and [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]]. The French established their own as well along the [[Mississippi River]]. Successful [[English overseas possessions|English settlement]] on the eastern coast of North America began with the [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia Colony]] in 1607 at [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] and the [[Pilgrims (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims']] [[Plymouth Colony]] in 1620. Many settlers were [[English Dissenters|dissenting Christian groups]] who came seeking [[freedom of religion|religious freedom]]. The continent's first elected legislative assembly, Virginia's [[House of Burgesses]] created in 1619, the [[Mayflower Compact]], signed by the Pilgrims before disembarking, and the [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut]], established precedents for the pattern of representative self-government and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the American colonies.&lt;ref name="Remini2‚Äì3">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Remini|2007|pp=2‚Äì3}}&lt;/ref>&lt;ref name="Johnson26‚Äì30">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Johnson|1997|pp=26‚Äì30}}&lt;/ref>

Most settlers in every colony were small farmers, but other industries developed within a few decades as varied as the settlements. [[Cash crops]] included tobacco, rice, and wheat. Extraction industries grew up in furs, fishing and lumber. Manufacturers produced rum and ships, and by the late colonial period, Americans were producing one-seventh of the world's iron supply.&lt;ref>[[#Walton|Walton, 2009]], chapter 3&lt;/ref> Cities eventually dotted the coast to support local economies and serve as trade hubs. English colonists were supplemented by waves of [[Scotch-Irish American|Scotch-Irish]] and other groups. As coastal land grew more expensive, freed [[Indentured servitude|indentured servants]] pushed further west.&lt;ref>[[#Lemon|Lemon, 1987]]&lt;/ref>

With the [[1860 United States presidential election|1860 election]] of [[Abraham Lincoln]], the first president from the largely anti-slavery [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], conventions in thirteen slave states ultimately declared secession and formed the [[Confederate States of America]] (the "South"), while the federal government (the "[[Union (American Civil War)|Union]]") maintained that secession was illegal.&lt;ref name="O'Brien2002qs" /> In order to bring about this secession, military action was initiated by the secessionists, and the Union responded in kind. The ensuing war would become the deadliest military conflict in American history, resulting in the deaths of approximately 618,000 soldiers as well as many civilians.&lt;ref>{{cite book |last=Vinovskis |first=Maris |date=1990 |title=Toward A Social History of the American Civil War: Exploratory Essays |page=4 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge; New York |isbn=978-0-521-39559-5}}&lt;/ref> The South fought for the freedom to own slaves, while the Union at first simply fought to maintain the country as one united whole. Nevertheless, as casualties mounted after 1863 and Lincoln delivered his [[Emancipation Proclamation]], the main purpose of the war from the Union's viewpoint became the abolition of slavery. Indeed, when the Union ultimately won the war in April 1865, each of the states in the defeated South was required to ratify the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], which prohibited slavery.

[[Reconstruction Amendments|Three amendments]] were added to the U.S. Constitution in the years after the war: the aforementioned Thirteenth as well as the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] providing citizenship to the nearly four million [[African American]]s who had been slaves,&lt;ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1860a-02.pdf |title=1860 Census |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |accessdate=June 10, 2007}} Page 7 lists a total slave population of 3,953,760.&lt;/ref> and the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] ensuring in theory that African Americans had the right to vote.

[[Reconstruction (United States)|Reconstruction]] began in earnest following the war. While President Lincoln attempted to foster friendship and forgiveness between the Union and the former Confederacy, [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|his assassination]] on April 14, 1865, drove a wedge between North and South again. Republicans in the federal government made it their goal to oversee the rebuilding of the South and to ensure the rights of African Americans. They persisted until the [[Compromise of 1877]] when the Republicans agreed to cease protecting the rights of African Americans in the South in order for Democrats to concede the [[1876 United States presidential election|presidential election of 1876]].

Southern white Democrats, calling themselves "[[Redeemers]]", took control of the South after the end of Reconstruction. From 1890 to 1910, so-called [[Jim Crow laws]] [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchised]] most blacks and some poor whites throughout the region.

The [[U.S. Census Bureau]] numerically ranks population areas by [[List of United States cities by population|city]], [[List of metropolitan statistical areas|metropolitan statistical areas]] (MSAs), and larger [[List of combined statistical areas|combined statistical areas]] (CSAs).

Estimates for the year 2018 show that 53 [[List of Metropolitan Statistical Areas|metropolitan areas]] have populations greater than one million.  Many metros in the South, Southwest and West grew significantly between 2010 and 2018. The [[Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex|Dallas]] and [[Greater Houston|Houston]] metros increased by more than a million people, while the [[Washington metropolitan area|Washington, D.C.]], [[Miami metropolitan area|Miami]], [[Atlanta metropolitan area|Atlanta]], and [[Phoenix metropolitan area|Phoenix]] metros all grew by more than 500,000 people.

In addition to official census groupings based on the aforementioned city, MSA, and CSA level, clusters of American cities can also be known as [[Megaregions of the United States|megaregions]]: the largest being the [[Great Lakes Megalopolis]] followed by the [[Northeast Megalopolis]] and [[Southern California]].

The Constitution has been amended 27 times;&lt;ref>[[#Feldstein|Feldstein, Fabozzi, 2011]], p. 9&lt;/ref> the first ten amendments, which make up the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], and the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] form the central basis of Americans' individual rights. All laws and governmental procedures are subject to [[judicial review]] and any law ruled by the courts to be in violation of the Constitution is voided. The principle of judicial review, not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, was established by the Supreme Court in ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'' (1803)&lt;ref>[[#Schultz|Schultz, 2009]], pp. 164, 453, 503&lt;/ref> in a decision handed down by [[John Marshall|Chief Justice John Marshall]].&lt;ref>[[#Schultz|Schultz, 2009]], p. 38&lt;/ref>

=== Science and technology ===

[[File:Aldrin Apollo 11 original.jpg|thumb|[[Buzz Aldrin]] on the Moon, 1969]]

The United States has been a leader in technological innovation since the late 19th century and scientific research since the mid-20th century. Methods for producing [[interchangeable parts]] were developed by the U.S. War Department by the Federal Armories during the first half of the 19th century. This technology, along with the establishment of a [[machine tool]] industry, enabled the U.S. to have large-scale manufacturing of sewing machines, bicycles, and other items in the late 19th century and became known as the [[American system of manufacturing]]. Factory [[electrification]] in the early 20th century and introduction of the [[assembly line]] and other labor-saving techniques created the system called [[mass production]].&lt;ref>{{Hounshell1984}}&lt;/ref>

In 1876, [[Alexander Graham Bell]] was awarded the first U.S. [[Invention of the telephone|patent for the telephone]]. [[Thomas Edison]]'s [[Research institute|research laboratory]], one of the first of its kind, developed the [[phonograph]], the first [[Incandescent light bulb|long-lasting light bulb]], and the first viable [[Kinetoscope|movie camera]].&lt;ref name=Edison>{{cite web |title=Thomas Edison's Most Famous Inventions |url=http://www.thomasedison.org/index.php/education/inventions/ |website=Thomas A Edison Innovation Foundation |accessdate=January 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref> The latter led to emergence of the worldwide [[Show business|entertainment industry]]. In the early 20th century, the automobile companies of [[Ransom E. Olds]] and [[Henry Ford]] popularized the assembly line.

The four major broadcasters in the U.S. are the [[NBC|National Broadcasting Company]] (NBC), [[CBS|Columbia Broadcasting System]] (CBS), [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC), and [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] (FOX). The four major broadcast [[television network]]s are all commercial entities. [[Cable television in the United States|Cable television]] offers hundreds of channels catering to a variety of niches.&lt;ref>{{cite news |title=Streaming TV Services: What They Cost, What You Get |url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/10/12/business/ap-us-streaming-tv-options.html |accessdate=October 12, 2015 |work=NYTimes.com |agency=Associated Press |date=October 12, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015023520/https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/10/12/business/ap-us-streaming-tv-options.html |archivedate=October 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref> Americans listen to radio programming, also largely commercial, on average just over two-and-a-half hours a day.&lt;ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emarketer.com/Article.aspx?R=1004830 |title=TV Fans Spill into Web Sites |date=June 7, 2007 |publisher=eMarketer |accessdate=June 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref>

In 1998, the number of U.S. commercial radio stations had grown to 4,793 AM stations and 5,662 FM stations. In addition, there are 1,460 public radio stations. Most of these stations are run by universities and public authorities for educational purposes and are financed by public or private funds, subscriptions, and corporate underwriting. Much public-radio broadcasting is supplied by [[NPR]] (formerly National Public Radio). NPR was incorporated in February 1970 under the [[Public Broadcasting Act of 1967]]; its television counterpart, [[PBS]], was also created by the same legislation (NPR and PBS are operated separately from each other). {{As of|2014|09|30|df=US}}, there are 15,433 licensed full-power radio stations in the U.S. according to the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC).&lt;ref>{{cite web |last=Waits |first=Jennifer |title=Number of U.S. Radio Stations on the Rise, Especially LPFM, according to New FCC Count |website=Radio Survivor |date=October 17, 2014 |accessdate=January 6, 2015 |url=http://www.radiosurvivor.com/2014/10/17/number-u-s-radio-stations-rise-especially-lpfm-according-latest-fcc-count/}}&lt;/ref>

Well-known newspapers include ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', and ''[[USA Today]]''.&lt;ref name="Shaffer2006">{{cite book |author=Brenda Shaffer |title=The Limits of Culture: Islam and Foreign Policy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uEOd-cDWVwQC&amp;pg=PA116 |year=2006 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-19529-4 |page=116}}&lt;/ref> Although the cost of publishing has increased over the years, the price of newspapers has generally remained low, forcing newspapers to rely more on advertising revenue and on articles provided by a major wire service, such as the [[Associated Press]] or [[Reuters]], for their national and world coverage. With very few exceptions, all the newspapers in the U.S. are privately owned, either by large chains such as [[Gannett Company|Gannett]] or [[The McClatchy Company|McClatchy]], which own dozens or even hundreds of newspapers; by small chains that own a handful of papers; or in a situation that is increasingly rare, by individuals or families. Major cities often have "alternative weeklies" to complement the mainstream daily papers, for example, New York City's ''[[The Village Voice]]'' or Los Angeles' ''[[LA Weekly]]'', to name two of the best-known. Major cities may also support a local business journal, trade papers relating to local industries, and papers for local ethnic and social groups. Early versions of the American newspaper [[comic strip]] and the [[American comic book]] began appearing in the 19th century. In 1938, [[Superman]], the comic book [[superhero]] of [[DC Comics]], developed into an American icon.&lt;ref>{{cite book |last=Daniels |first=Les |authorlink=Les Daniels |year=1998 |title=Superman: The Complete History |page=11 |edition=1st |publisher=Titan Books |isbn=978-1-85286-988-5}}&lt;/ref> Aside from [[web portal]]s and [[web search engine|search engines]], the most popular websites are [[Facebook]], [[YouTube]], [[Wikipedia]], [[Yahoo!]], [[eBay]], [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]], and [[Twitter]].&lt;ref name="alexa-topsitesus">{{cite web |url=http://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries/US |title=Top Sites in United States |year=2014 |publisher=Alexa |accessdate=October 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref>

More than 800 publications are produced in Spanish, the second most commonly used language in the United States behind English.&lt;ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.w3newspapers.com/usa/spanish |title=Spanish Newspapers in United States |publisher=W3newspapers |accessdate=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref>&lt;ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.onlinenewspapers.com/usstate/spanish-language-newspapers-usa.htm |title=Spanish Language Newspapers in the USA : Hispanic Newspapers : Peri√≥discos en Espa√±ol en los EE.UU |publisher=Onlinenewspapers.com |accessdate=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref>
