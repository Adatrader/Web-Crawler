For example there is one firm in the template <a href="/wiki/Targetfollow" title="Targetfollow">Targetfollow</a> that seems to have gone through a (partial?) bankruptcy.  I can't find anything on that bankruptcy and how the company emerged from it.  It seems to me that if we can't report on something as obviously important as that, then we shouldn't have an article on the firm.  And the main reason that we can't report much on the bankruptcy, is that there doesn't seem to be much of anything about it on the web.</dd>
<dd>The same type of thing happens with many other templates, e.g. the Burger King template gives about 70 links, a slight majority being to "purely Burger King" articles such as those on their advertising campaigns (<a href="/wiki/Where%27s_Herb%3F" title="Where&#39;s Herb?">Where's Herb?</a>, <a href="/wiki/The_Subservient_Chicken" title="The Subservient Chicken">The Subservient Chicken</a>, their products (<a href="/wiki/Burger_King_fish_sandwiches" title="Burger King fish sandwiches">Burger King fish sandwiches</a>).  That is a whopping amount of free advertising on Wikipedia for one company.</dd>
<dd>It's not just templates, e.g. <a href="/wiki/Template:Lehigh_Valley_Malls" title="Template:Lehigh Valley Malls">Template:Lehigh Valley Malls</a>, where you can find lists of this type of advertising articles.  There are "lists of companies in industry X" e.g. <a href="/wiki/List_of_companies_operating_nursing_homes" title="List of companies operating nursing homes">List of companies operating nursing homes</a>, and in categories (<a href="/wiki/Category:Unbuilt_buildings_and_structures_in_the_United_States" title="Category:Unbuilt buildings and structures in the United States">Category:Unbuilt buildings and structures in the United States</a>, with 4 sub-categories and 85 articles).

<dl><dd>The list articles are another easy way to pull these out of the orphan work queue. Of course it's not impossible to notice this, if you pay any attention at all to Wikipedia content. What do you expect when you don't pay for content, and you don't pay anyone to edit the content? You can delete their article, <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Salt" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:Salt">salt</a> the page, and they <i>still</i> keep coming back (some of them may be paid to not take no for an answer) – you may find a <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Content_fork" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:Content fork">fork</a> created at an alternative title that you didn't lock down. Just as with email, without automated spam filters the unpaid volunteers will always be outgunned. Good luck convincing the WMF to develop spam filters.

If people know that they are going to be bombarded by advertising when the come to Wikipedia then they will stop coming to Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>If you can come up with some sort of spam filter, please do.  Or perhaps just something simple like a bot that will give an "advertising score" to a selected article.  It shouldn't be that hard: PR folks have a very special vocabulary.

<dd>We have something resembling a crude spam filter in userspace, see <a href="/wiki/Special:AbuseFilter/354" title="Special:AbuseFilter/354">Special:Abusefilter/354</a> (edit filter manager + admins only), with about a 50% delete on sight rate.

I think something like that could be helped, but I hope it would not immediately block the work, but simply identify it as needing review for puffery (or as an attack page), and sending it immediately to a board like <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:AfD" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:AfD">WP:AfD</a> for wide review.

The code for the edit-filter that detects swearing type vandalism might be a good starting place.  Review and analysis of articles that have been deleted for puffery would help in looking for language patterns that a bot could detect, rather than simply searching for specific words.  A similar filter could be used to detect attack pages.  Unfortunately, the deleted pages are inaccessible.  It would be nice if someone who worked at hotmail, gmail, etc. on spam filters who knows the latest techniques could share their expertise.  There might even be scholarly articles on the subject in a Computer Science Journals.  It's a slightly different task for us, of course, in that email spam detection tools I have encountered tend of focus first on the email address names and extensions, but the techniques should be similar. <i>Will take note of post right above</i> in just a sec. --<a href="/wiki/User:David_Tornheim" title="User:David Tornheim">David Tornheim</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:David_Tornheim" title="User talk:David Tornheim">talk</a>) 02:38, 8 May 2017 (UTC)
<dl><dd><dl><dd>David, thanks for the interest.  I can add all the encouragement that you need, but my bot skills are nil. But please, go for it.  I'll add one further method and ping <span class="template-ping">@<a href="/wiki/User:Halfak_(WMF)" title="User:Halfak (WMF)">Halfak (WMF)</a>:</span>. He uses AI and does things like the article/revision scoring system ORES. It is great stuff.  I'm sure he could do something like the following (huge caveat at the end):
<ul><li>Organize a scoring session where human volunteers score hundreds of articles as "advertising/abusive" or "not"</li>
<li>Use his AI skills to predict how humans will score articles out of the sample</li>
<li>Do this on thousands of articles, and publish the scores, or just let individuals do it for whatever articles they wish</li>
<li>Caveats, he always says that his skills are in high demand at the WMF (they are) and that he has limited time (I'm sure that's also correct), plus I have a very limited idea of AI and can only really say that the above is what he's done for general article scoring.</li></ul></dd>
<dd>I think that a limited purpose, grind-it-out bot would be a wonderful tools to start with, and an AI scoring system would be amazing.  <a href="/wiki/User:Smallbones" title="User:Smallbones">Smallbones</a><sub>(<font color="cc6600"><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Smallbones" title="User talk:Smallbones">smalltalk</a></font>)</sub> 03:47, 8 May 2017 (UTC)
<dl><dd><span class="template-ping">@<a href="/wiki/User:Smallbones" title="User:Smallbones">Smallbones</a>:</span>  Yes.  AI would work for that.  I took an AI class a long time ago, and also worked with <a href="/wiki/Neural_nets" class="mw-redirect" title="Neural nets">neural nets</a>.  A neural net could be optimized/programmed to produce scores that are very close to what humans have marked as puffery on a specific set of articles (as inputs) and the score is the output [like a function with a domain; y = f(x), where x is an article's wiki-text and y=the score for puffery].  The challenge is to get it to make the right prediction from articles that it has not seen yet.

<h2><span id="Turkey.2C_North_Korea_and_Russia"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Turkey,_North_Korea_and_Russia">Turkey, North Korea and Russia</span></h2>
<p>A few weeks ago (1 week before the Turkey ban) I visited the Erdogan and Turkey pages and noted that anyone reading the leads of either of these "pristine" pages, would probably walk away with no idea that Turkey is now being run by a man who has locked up most of the journalists in his country, and who has rigged his way into becoming effectively Turkey's next new sultan.  I then fixed both of these leads to better reflect "reality," whether or not Planet-WP was ready to reflect it in the article leads or not.  Sure enough, a week later we got banned by Turkey.  Jimbo's response to Erdogan's request to "fix" WP to his own liking was basically "we stand for free speech here, not for dictatorial suppression of same."  I salute Jimbo for this, despite some editor's concerns that read that "Jimbo can't really tell US what to do."
</p><p>Yesterday I paid a visit to <a href="/wiki/Kim_Jong-un" title="Kim Jong-un">Kim Jong-un</a>'s lovely page, and strangely noted the same problem there.  After reading just the lead, one would have probably wanted to move to wonderful N. Korea, so good was this man!  Same problem on the <a href="/wiki/Putin" class="mw-redirect" title="Putin">Putin</a> page too.  Not a single ref in the lead that Putin happens to be fond of assassinating anyone who gets in his way!  Egads!!  Is Planet-WP really still in touch with planet Earth?
</p><p>I've since  "fixed" the two pages for both of those two wonderful leaders, and perhaps a little later I hope to review and fix the leads of both of their two related "country pages" (if needed.)  Why do I seem to be the only one around here so far who cares enough to fix these things in these leads?  I sincerely hope more might assist in this fight for free speech that WP could be, and that my own physical safety as so far being the lone voice in this, regarding the article leads, is not affected.  
</p><p>I know that some of the residents of Planet-WP will probably now complain to no end that WP has no business fighting for free speech, we're just a fancy news aggregating service here and nothing more.  If that is really all we are, then I quit, really.  We are ultimately all here to be actual providers of Truth, whether we like it or not.  Sure we have an arcane system of approving our edits, but that system was designed specifically to yield the closest thing to Truth that it could.  The Truth was not designed to fit the arcane system of edit verification!  Some editors here seem to occasionally have a much greater preference for arcanity than for Truth.  You all have my express permission to be amongst Elon Musk's first chosen ones to go to Mars.  On second thought, please never lose touch with our humble planet Earth.  Please never stop being grounded in Truth.

I have no doubt that there are more of them than there are of me.  By WP's arcane rules, will Fake News prevail on Putin's page?  Yes.  That is, yes unless there are at least a few Wikipedians who are willing to come back down to Earth and help me over there!  Please somebody come down out of your safe ivory tower on Planet-WP and actually help me with their next attempt at what is essentially vandalism in the name of censorship, in the name of supposed WP:NPOV over there.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Page-guardians">Page-guardians</span></h3>
<p>I will admit, the "style" of my first "bringing in reality" edit was not the best, and only after I got the "moral support" of another editor, was I even able to think straight enough to write more accurately and clearly as I should have in the first place.  I did also carefully review the edit history of the first editor to revert me, and indeed that fellow had a long and consistent history of always removing info from the Putin article that was critical of Putin, and of many noticeboard battles, and an in depth knowledge of our arcane rules to try to support his edits.  I think its safe to say he's a "pro-putin guardian of that page."  I didn't have time to do such an analysis of the second guy.  Admittedly, for all I know, that guy, who reverted while ignoring my "edit comment to go to the talk page before reverting," and who left no "edit comment" of his own, could have simply been reverting for merely stylistic reasons.  I would say that the information is now better presented with less potential for reasonable and purely stylistic objections.  
</p><p>Who was the first editor who reverted?  It appeared to me that he probably is what I will call a "self appointed page guardian" who has personally decided to guard that page against Putin-critical edits, probably due to his own personal fondness for the man.  Do such page-guardians exist in WP?  You know they do. I used to be one myself at an obscure article on a certain theological topic, but have personally recused myself from editing there, knowing I need to work on my own personal tendency towards POV-blindness on that one topic.  This is what I will call idealogical-POV-blindness, and I will be the first to admit that I may have it on that one topic.  Then there is what I will call favor-based-POV-blindness.  I consider idealogical-POV-blindness at WP to be far less problematic than favor-based-POV-blindness.  
</p><p>When I first evaluated the editor who did the first revert, I checked him out to see which type of editor he was.  He looked to me like he probably only suffered from what I'm calling idealogical-POV-blindness, and for that I was quite relieved.  As we all know, Putin has almost certainly recently used his favors to "throw" a presidential election in a major democracy.  Who is to say he could'nt try to use them to "throw" an iddy biddy WP article?
</p><p>I don't think WP's little page-guardian problem is ever directly identified, let alone directly discussed in any one WP policy.  Personally I think it could probably have a whole policy to itself, but our policy section itself happens to be ran by a bunch of idealogical-page-guardians, who mercelessly attack, in coordinated fashion, anyone else who dares to move even a comma on those pages.  
</p><p>Having just made this not so humble observation, now they may soon try to use their "wiles" on me here, who knows?  We've all seen what I will call an editorial-gang-bang, but that is another sweet topic that is "politely hush hush," around here.  <a href="/wiki/User:Scottperry" title="User:Scottperry">Scott P.</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Scottperry" title="User talk:Scottperry">talk</a>) 14:42, 7 May 2017 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Scott clearly Im the first editor, anyone could see that. Hello Jimbo it appears Im invading your page. But after being identified here (tiny check) I have to say I dont have much choice and that I like your spirit Scott but IMHO you have a few things backwards. One. I cant speak for others, but I only have time to watchlist so many pages, 7 or so currently, and then do them justice so to speak. This may look like Guardian behaviour, but in the real world its not. Its about time management. Two. You would not believe the vandalism on the Putin page in the past, so we get a bit reactive you could say when someone comes in and puts edgy stuff on a <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:BLP" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:BLP">WP:BLP</a> It may not survive review. But Im glad we emailed each other and I got to know you a little. Do remember I tried to warn you in a friendly manner about 3RR on your talk page. Lastly heres the other thing. Putin is the target of a lot of innuendo, smear, Russophobia and the like. Oh its RS for sure because MSM in the West is fairly tighly controlled, but a lot of it is BLP violation. Scott You seem like a crusader for Truth. Thats often a hard road. Truth is a hard commodity to pin down and there is a lot of <a href="/wiki/Denialism" title="Denialism">Denialism</a> around especially when its not protocol but RS is. I admire that you are trying but ask that you consider widenning and deepenning your knowledge base because there is another way to look at this. That WP is too valuable a resource to not be used by the Elites to further their agendas and that Putin and Russia are in their way. I have put a few thoughts about WP here<a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:SaintAviator">[2]</a>  that apply that you may or may not have seen when researching me. Please also consider using the names of editors, its more transparent, when you talk about them in ways that are not exactly civil like 'idealogical-POV-blindness'. No I reject that and your general thrust imho is misplaced. <a href="/wiki/User:SaintAviator" title="User:SaintAviator"><b style="color:blue">Saint<span style="color:red">Aviator</span></b></a> <a href="/wiki/User_talk:SaintAviator" title="User talk:SaintAviator"><i style="color:blue">lets talk</i></a> 08:58, 8 May 2017 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Aviator, (<span class="template-ping">@<a href="/wiki/User:SaintAviator" title="User:SaintAviator">SaintAviator</a>:</span>) I feel that you raise some very good points above.  Probably most of us here have probably been "page guardians" of some sort or another at some point in time.  Most aspects of being a "page guardian" are obviously positive, but I feel that there are also a few potential risks to this very important (and usually helpful) role around here.   I suspect that everyone here probably already knows what I'm about to say.  Page Guardians sometimes tend to become obstinate and possessive of the pages they guard.  I feel that this can sometimes result in their actually harming the page more than helping it.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Unfortunately, Wikipedia's policy pages probably have the fiercest crew of page guardians in the whole place.  Admittedly this crew does perform a necessary task, because policy pages really should not even be editable at all by newbies, so they effectively keep the newbies out from our policy section, which must be done.  Still, due to this the presence of this now necessary crew, our policies have been allowed to be modeled by this very same crew, which in my mind do not really understand them themselves.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>This all argues for two closely related things, which Jimbo has thus far not yet been very flexible with the rest of us on:
<ol><li><b>Accountability</b> More accountability of one another and of Wikimedia is needed around here, in order to be able to better understand, trust and respect one another around here.</li>
<li><b>Transparency</b> More transparency as to exactly how such vital processes as policy decisions actually work around here, is needed in order to keep WP policies as helpful for the rest of us Wikipedians as possible.</li></ol></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Possibly Wikimedia paid page guardians of the policy section, come on?  Resulting policies that are steadily eroding the freedom of speech within WP itself, come on?</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>First, I will say this, I have no clue as to whether or not Wikimedia pays the policy page guardians to do what they do, but I do have at least a strong hunch that probably Jimbo has personally asked them to do what they do, if not more.  Do I fault Jimbo for probably doing this? No. My guess is that he probably did this because he couldn't think of any other way to do it better.  Do I still think that WP needs more transparency? For God's sake, YES.  Even if my hunch might be mistaken about Jimbo asking the policy page guardians to do what they do, the level of transparency around here makes it impossible for me to be able to even have a clue as to this whether or not this is true, and this level of opacity around here seems to me to be quite counterproductive.</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>I haven't seen the logs for this interaction, so I could be mistaken regarding this one particular case, but EGB is a serious problem around here, and it usually translates as, "There are two of us here who somewhat know WP's fuzzy policies, and only one of you, so we win and you're a donkey.

<dl><dd>In a typical EGB discussion, the EGB'ers will pretend to be the most officious know-it-alls, deeply familiar with years of fuzzy policy, and the poor EGB-ee gets to be the "poor benighted idiot," being patiently and tenderly taught by the obviously superior intellects of the exalted ones.  Meanwhile nobody listens to a single valid rationale that the EGBee has patiently tried to express. Of course not, poor benighted fools never have anything to say, why they're poor benighted fools of course!  Wonderful system of deriving the Truth, if I don't say so myself. While we pretend at "respecting one another" around here, there is all too often a clear "subtext" of very real contempt for one another, which is always counterproductive, and unfortunately all too well tolerated around here. But will I soon be EGB'ed for daring to speak the Truth here?  We shall see.  <a href="/wiki/User:Scottperry" title="User:Scottperry">Scott P.</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Scottperry" title="User talk:Scottperry">talk</a>) 15:48, 7 May 2017 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_WP-fishbowl_effect">The WP-fishbowl effect</span></h3>
<p>What I see here is four editors (myself and three others) whose communications between one another are all suffering from what I will call the WP-fishbowl-effect.  I see each of us as quite well intended, and each attempting to respectfully engage in the best communications possible, but due to what I call the WP-fishbowl-effect, little or no "real communications" are able to occurr here.  When I first read smallbones' first reply, I would have to say this comment could be taken in various different ways, so yes, I must confess that only for the purposes of better illustrating the WP-fishbowl effect, I did indeed "intentionally select" which way I wanted to take it, knowing full well I was probably wrong.  The point I hoped to illustrate by doing this here is how easy such mis-communication is here in what I am calling the WP-fishbowl where I believe that there is sometimes a certain group-dynamic that can at times systematically encourage miscommunication.  Please forgive me for this intentional 'effect.'
</p><p>I see many harder editorial decisions at WP derailed or mishandled many times by this effect.  Also I hope you might forgive me for the slightly crude terminology, but I used it here, simply because I felt I needed to get somebody's attention.  Why does WP always have a problem getting female editors on board?  It's because of what I've called the EGB effect, is so perilously close to what the initials actually stand for.  It's whenever a group of editors on some level agree that another lone-editor is suddenly essentially "worthless" as an editor, but they never explicitly say it, they only suddenly all agree to EGB the lone-editor.  They will then use words/ phrase like "ranter" or "doesn't understand," or "if only [lone editor] had understood or read this or that," ect. etc.  All of these types of 'code phrases' are really EGB phrases, though nobody really realizes it.  
</p><p>Please think about the implications of this.  None of these types of phrases actually have a thing to do with the actual 'idea' being proposed.  All of them are really subtle ad-hominem attacks against the lone-editor, implying that the lone editor's ideas must simply be worthless because the lone-editor is obviously 'inferior to' the EGB'ers.  Women are able to pick up on the rather unpleasant sensation of the EGB faster than we men, simply because the female species has been both physically and mentally GB'd for millenia, and they get the H out of here.

<dl><dd><span class="template-ping">@<a href="/wiki/User:Scottperry" title="User:Scottperry">Scottperry</a>:</span> Early in my wiki career, a very wise Wikipedian, now a steward, advised me that discussion should take place on wiki as much as possible. While I think I have encountered situations where a private email discussion was warranted, this doesn't remotely sound like such an example. I don't think Jimbo's talk pages the right place, but if you'd like to discuss on your talk page or mine, or the talk page of some relevant WP page, let me know.--<a href="/wiki/User:Sphilbrick" title="User:Sphilbrick"><span style="color:#000E2F;padding:0 4px;font-family: Copperplate Gothic Light">S Philbrick</span></a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Sphilbrick" title="User talk:Sphilbrick"><span style=";padding:0 4px;color:# 000;font-family: Copperplate Gothic Light">(Talk)</span></a> 15:15, 8 May 2017 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><span class="template-ping">@<a href="/wiki/User:Sphilbrick" title="User:Sphilbrick">Sphilbrick</a>:</span> , Thanks kindly for your generous offer here.  I think I may be starting to understand, just a little more, why everyone here hesitates to discuss these things privately via email.  Perhaps it's a concern about possible "factioning," that could result, which has the potential of sowing even greater discord in an already highly discordant place.  This is a legitimate concern, and I thank you for in some sense, helping me to figure out what I will call the "internal-conspiracy-concern-effect."  This effect is certainly very real, and would obviously have to be addressed in any new proposed dispute resolution process.  Here is a concern of mine.  It is one aspect of what I am calling the fishbowl-effect.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>You see one of the clear downsides of doing all discussions in the WP-fishbowl is the fact that anyone from a first-day-newbie to Jimbo has the right to barge into any one-on-one conversation, and to then completely derail the original train of thought, to commandeer the conversation, to completely squelch whatever the original train of thought was.  Or better yet, two or more could invite themselves into the conversation, and turn the conversation into a completely different topic from the chosen topic of the first two, which could in fact be something that the first two were fundamentally opposed to even discussing!</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>The good 'ole WP-fishbowl leaves my head spinning often, and leaves me often feeling quite frustrated and unable to carry on what I consider to be a truly intelligent conversation with anyone else here.  Ultimately my point is: The traditional WP-fishbowl may not always be the best environment to have meaningful conversations with others, where ideas can be permitted to properly develop in the same way they often do in real life conversations between just two people.  This is why I wanted to use email so badly, but please let me try to sort of "compromise" with you in the following proposal:</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>I propose the following  "compromise solution" here, and I believe it is along the lines of what you have earlier proposed, and I hope that you might consider it.  I would certainly be willing to discuss these things with you openly on my talk page, but only if you would agree to two simple rules in advance.  Perhaps now you will see my rationale for these two proposed simple discussion rules.  I will call these two rules the "no-ad-hominem" rule, and the "one-to-one" rule.  By using these two simple rules on my talk page, I feel that a normal one-to-one conversation could be roughly "simulated" there.  Here are the full descrcriptions of these  two rules:
<ol><li><b>No ad-hominem</b>, means that we would have to each promise one another not to make any personal attacks against the other, either explicitly or implicitly, during the course of our one-to-one conversation.</li>
<li><b>One to one</b>, means that we would have to promise one another that one or both of us will politely dismiss any third party who might try to join in on our one-to-one conversation, until we are both satisfied that the conversation has finally reached its logical end.</li></ol></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>The very reason I feel that I was just able to think clearly enough to put the above "compromise proposal" together, was actually due to your own agreement already, in the one comment you just made above, which had no ad-hominem wording in it, and was quite politely and well worded, if you don't mind me saying so.  I believe that the "kindness" on your part just now actually allowed for perhaps a kinder response from myself.  Perhaps a more polite label for what I have previously called the EGB-effect, would be the Ad-hominem-effect.  In both cases, there is a subtle subtext of contempt.  I believe that if there was a willingness to openly admit that the Ad-hominem-effect goes on a little too often around here, and to admit that a "lid" needs to somehow be placed upon it, that both the editorial environment and the quality of our articles would be significantly improved.</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dl><dd>Sort of. (As an aside, ad hominem is not a synonym for personal attack. The Venn diagreams have overlap, but many ad hominems are not personal attacks, and many personal attacks are not ad hominems. I'll read your request as wishing to avoid personal attacks, which is easy to agree to.)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>I have one concern, easily addressed. Both my talk page and yours are intended for discussion, and it is quite inappropriate to uninvite third parties. Technically, a user subpage might also qualify as a page where we do not have the full right to exclude third parties, but historical practice suggests that such a request should be honored. So it you would like to create a personal user subpage (or I can) other than the main talk page, I'll try a discussion.--<a href="/wiki/User:Sphilbrick" title="User:Sphilbrick"><span style="color:#000E2F;padding:0 4px;font-family: Copperplate Gothic Light">S Philbrick</span></a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Sphilbrick" title="User talk:Sphilbrick"><span style=";padding:0 4px;color:# 000;font-family: Copperplate Gothic Light">(Talk)</span></a> 20:01, 8 May 2017 (UTC)

Its happened before, they were caught then by a whistleblower and banned for periods like a year. I believe they could be back and also its very possible some sock puppets have been missed from that time and are now seen as established editors. Also legit accounts can be accessed remotely by programs like <a href="/wiki/Team_viewer" class="mw-redirect" title="Team viewer">Team viewer</a>, allowing one editor to engage mulilple accounts by agreement with other gang members. Essentially meat puppets. Why do I say these things? Because the coordination of responses is too suspicious. I am not the first to notice this, there have been numerous ANI on and around it.

Because you didn't do this, it tells me that you probably did (at least on a procedural level) actually listen to what I had to say, and you probably did sense that there may be at least some small grain of truth to it, so perhaps you had best just let me "rant" and maybe not send me off to the "brig" (just yet.)

<dl><dd>No, agreement with the central point made by Count Iblis does not constitute an insult.

<dl><dd>The central point of Iblis was obviously not the 3 words "Wikipedia needs rules".  The only thing that's left is his comparing folks who want to stop paid advertising on Wikipedia (including me) to North Korea. I consider that worse than comparing me to Nazis.  And tarring many other people with that brush makes it even worse.  Both of you should apologize.</dd>
<dd>"simply because you don't like what she says" She is telling people to break our Terms of Use and put undeclared paid editing into our articles.  She is in a closely related business to paid editors (social media PR and advertising) and essentially says she is going to continue hiring paid editors, including for "her" article.  Why wouldn't we salt "her" article and ban her and her company from editing?</dd>

<ul><li>Smallbones, at one point I would have thought like you did... but serving real people in medicine has changed my perspective: I don't get to treat patients different based on who is nice to me, who smells better, who flirts with me, who shares my political views... none of that.  Impartiality is a virtue in medicine, and it should be in Wikipedia as well.  It's not.  Lots of people have grudges against things, and instead of all striving to be as impartial as possible, what we seem to end up getting is competing campaigns against this or that.

It might also attract scrutiny to a sleeper account that recreates the article.  I wasn't aware that people thought of this as cruel and unusual punishment.

<dd><a href="/wiki/User:Smallbones" title="User:Smallbones">Smallbones</a>, I feel your anger and frustration. This event, imo, is 1 more example of how the mere existence and metastasizing of paid editing within Wikipedia <i>is the disease</i>. I realize the matter of paid editing here has been talked to death with no concrete attack on the disease, but that does not mean we can continue to allow it. We have to take <i>drastic</i> action. Now I'm going to use an analogy which is always risky but I think it is a good one. <a href="/wiki/Uber_(company)" class="mw-redirect" title="Uber (company)">Uber</a>...please let me explain. It does not matter for the purpose of this analogy whether I or any of us like or want or use Uber, what matters is looking at the historical and current ways in which Uber has grown, and/or been accepted, and/or been prohibited and/or been effectively killed off. To start with, there really are <i>many</i> countries and jurisdictions which have killed off Uber or made life so difficult for it that Uber has pulled out of its own accord. But in order to get this done, those jurisdictions have resorted to extremely creative and or drastic approaches, like legislating sensors within Uber cars to detect the number of passengers as just 1 example. I remember 50 years ago we had what were called "bandit taxis" in Toronto. It was a crime and was considered so serious that the car being used could be seized and sold off at public auction. Then, and I don't need to tell you how powerful and competent Uber's legal and corporate team are, Uber has been able to largely break the existing rules, attract huge public support, and pressure jurisdictions into accepting their presence. But, my point is, <b>when there has been sufficient alarm, creativity and determination, they have been stopped.</b> So, imo, we have to get much more determined to attack and kill off any and all paid editing here. <a href="/wiki/User:Nocturnalnow" title="User:Nocturnalnow">Nocturnalnow</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Nocturnalnow" title="User talk:Nocturnalnow">talk</a>) 15:33, 8 May 2017 (UTC)</dd>

<dl><dd>I'm not angry at Amy Osmond Cook but I do feel some frustration when admins and an arb come here when asked "How can we best inform people that her advice is against our rules?" and all they can do is pretend that salting an article is cruel and unusual punishment.

But I've actually had experience with North Korean students, e.g. in the FSU, and what their government does is unspeakable.</dd>
<dd>So creative is great - there are a million ways to let Cook's readers know our rules.  I don't think "drastic" is necessary, though surprising or unexpected might be usefull.

<dl><dd>If you had cited the article and started with "How can we best inform people that her advice is against our rules?" you might have opened up a fruitful discussion. Instead, you opened with <i>May I suggest permanently salting the article Amy Osmond Cook?</i> I don't think it has sunk in how odious that proposal is. While NeilN correctly notes that salting "merely" means it takes an admin to allow the article, you didn't propose salting you proposed permanently salting, a concept that doesn't exist, but anyone with a brain knows what you intend.

<dl><dd>She definitely did say some nasty things about Wikipedia, e.g. "The real rules of the game are hidden, political, and bizarre." I'm not mad about that. In fact I think it is correct.  It would be nice if we could have a simple discussion about how we actually can respond in an open, apolitical, simple way to somebody who not only violates our paid editing and meatpuppeting rules, but acknowledges it off-Wiki, and encourages everybody else to do the same.  I do not think it's appropriate to say that I'm being "odious" for suggesting salting the article on this person, rather the only appropriate response is to discuss what steps we should take to let people know that her advice is totally against our rules.  One nasty thing she said is that one or more of our editors who deleted the article are "trolls".  Presumably she is referring to <span class="template-ping">@<a href="/wiki/User:DGG" title="User:DGG">DGG</a>:</span> who listed the article for deletion. DGG has likely gotten over this, I'd guess he's been called worse, but her almost random striking out is indeed odious.  A bit more - articles apparently written by her or her company have been deleted including <a href="/w/index.php?title=Osmond_Marketing&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Osmond Marketing (page does not exist)">Osmond Marketing</a>, and 2 likely clients <a href="/wiki/Ryan_Westwood" class="mw-redirect" title="Ryan Westwood">Ryan Westwood</a>, and <a href="/w/index.php?title=Amada_Senior_Care&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Amada Senior Care (page does not exist)">Amada Senior Care</a>. Ryan Westwood was written by a related editor, deleted twice (the first time as part of the Orange Moody scandal). Amada Senior Care appears to be a regular client, the same related editor was also involved.   She's been practicing what she preaches.  Responding to this is not unWikipedian, but refusing to recognize her actions as a problem is.

<p>I do not support any punitive measures against potential BLP subjects, regardless of whether or not site policies have been broken. <a href="/wiki/User:Mr_Ernie" title="User:Mr Ernie">Mr Ernie</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Mr_Ernie" title="User talk:Mr Ernie">talk</a>) 19:12, 8 May 2017 (UTC)
</p><p>(EC) I don't see why punitive measures cannot be considered.  To respond to Smallbones' question, here are three consequences I suggest:
</p>
<dl><dd><ul><li>1. I find the Entrepreneur article to be kind of breezy and amusing at first, but then the author explains what is against terms of use and advocates doing it anyhow.  This is unethical, and she seems proud of it.  It does not come across as funny or well-written, it seems like just hack work.  I personally think it is reasonable to assume that the author operates unethically in other arenas, i.e. I rather assume that they cheats on their taxes and rips off clients when they can;  sorry, that's my personal view, and I am not suggesting I have any real knowledge that they do, and this does not constitute slander.  It simply is embarrassing to see what they wrote, and I expect that many potential clients will see that, and will choose to avoid them.  Potential clients who themselves tend to cheat where they can, may appreciate her dishonesty, and engage, and then accidentally on purpose fail to pay their bill, which maybe would serve the author right.</li>
<li>2. The publisher is <a href="/wiki/Entrepreneur_(magazine)" title="Entrepreneur (magazine)">Entrepreneur (magazine)</a>, right?  The publisher is unethical for printing that.  Probably, maybe, they would see their way to publishing a retraction/apology, if they were called on the carpet for it.  Perhaps a well-written letter to the editor (do they publish letters to the editor?) with some balance of humor/sarcasm and actually-useful information for their readers would get published.  I am sure that ethics matter in business, and I rather expect that Entrepreneur is sometimes pointing out to entrepreneurs that ethical shortcuts have consequences (like that no investor will ever trust you, when they see you cheating others).  Any business owner who is seeking to get coverage in Wikipedia should consider the message they send to their employees and customers, that for this they will lie and cheat, yet they don't want the employees and customers to cheat them.  It would be fine if Wikipedia's legal counsel or the community director(s) mentioned in the articles would be the ones to speak up in this way.  It would be very appropriate for the community director to speak up and say their words were twisted if they were;  they would have standing.  And that could both educate Entrepreneur's readers and impose some consequence upon the author (that their work is trashed/retracted).</li>
<li>3. The article itself suggests a consequence that can be used.  It discusses a service called "Upwork" and discusses finding honest (but of course dishonest) paid writers there, and goes on "When you are ready to reach out, post the job with a dummy account that does not reveal your real name. Even if you reach out in a private message, any editor can see the job board once it has been posted. This is important because some Wikipedia trolls routinely look for work on Upwork; and, if they don’t get the job, they find the page that another editor wrote and take it down out of spite."  Okay, so run a sting-like operation.  This can be done by any volunteer Wikipedian, who could be rewarded by barnstars and the like.  Or it would be appropriate to give out grant funds to pay editors to do this, on general principle that the work done is protecting the quality of the volunteer editing experience for others.  Write a grant proposal.  In the sting operation, you create multiple paid writer identities, and do trolling for real.  Seek to get those private messages.  Seek to get hired.  Then burn those seeking to cheat.  Impose costs into that economic system.  Certainly put all the suggested redlinks onto your watchlist, and as part of the grant or whatever, continue to watch them forever, and see to deletion of future efforts (assuming that real notability is not obvious...I agree with SPhilbrick's point somewhat).  I believe the way that paid editing works is that if an article gets taken down, the paid author doesn't get paid, or has to refund part or all of their fees.  Impose costs on them, that they will perform work and then eventually have to forfeit fees.  It will be a continuous cat-and-mouse game with "Upwork" and other services, to figure out what are the violaters' strategies and to impose costs upon them.</li></ul></dd>
<dd>Hmm, those are my off-hand thoughts, along the lines of being vindictive.  I feel a bit dirty from taking this line, and I am not completely sure of my own moral stance on this.  Is it unethical to try to impose financial damage on real persons?  Is it somehow wrong for the Foundation to provide grant funds for such purposes?  Is it wrong for me to cast judgment on the article author?  I could perhaps be swayed by others views on this.  However, I certainly am not recommending anything illegal, and I don't think that anything I am writing here constitutes slander.  And offhand, I think it is allowable and even morally sensible/good to take negative actions against others, within the law.  That's what we pay police, and criminal prosecutors, etc., to do.  Hmm, what if trolling "Upwork" is against that service's terms of use.  That's quite likely, and I am not sure what is ethically okay to do there, then, but I would explore what can be done along those lines. --<a href="/wiki/User:Doncram" title="User:Doncram"><font color="maroon">do</font></a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Doncram" title="User talk:Doncram"><font color="green">ncr</font></a><a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/doncram" title="Special:Contributions/doncram"><font color="maroon">am</font></a> 19:37, 8 May 2017 (UTC)
<dl><dd>(EC)Thanks for coming up with some methods of addressing the actual problem.</dd>
<dd>I personally wouldn't suggest 3) we've had a heck of a time just to be able to link to these sites in very limited circumstances, without us getting banned here for harassment.</dd>
<dd>I'd also forget about "punitive" and concentrate on "preventative." Certainly any preventative action we take can be seen as having some punitive content (see above for some such reactions).  But the more we concentrate on preventative, such as getting the word out that we actually have rules that we enforce, the better.</dd>
<dd>The letter to the editor idea is great.

<dl><dd><dl><dd>Okay, good, can you run with the letter idea.  This could be highly appropriate for <a href="/wiki/User:Jimbo_Wales" title="User:Jimbo Wales">User:Jimbo Wales</a> to write.

<dd>However, why not be punitive.  Punitive is needed.  I think it is nice that you shrink from that, and it is nice that <a href="/wiki/User:Mr_Ernie" title="User:Mr Ernie">User:Mr Ernie</a> and most other readers here find it a bit abhorrent.  That's because you're nice people, and voluntarily contribute to Wikipedia.  The world of law enforcement, and the real ethics of sting operations etc., are not your world.  You and me probably think that it is wrong for police to lie, ever, and we tend to dislike anything that sounds like it was entrapment.  In the U.S., law enforcement against prostitution includes sting operations, where undercover cops pose as prostitutes and bust "johns", and there are undercover drug law enforcement operations where agents lie and violate lots of local laws and norms except probably usually not performing actual murders to prove themselves, and you and I don't really grok how those things can be allowed.  Although I am not familiar with that world myself, I am sure there is ethical lying and misrepresentation going on, that is ethical and appropriate.  It's not right for nice regular Wikipedia volunteers to have to engage in that kind of stuff.  It is highly appropriate for the Foundation, IMO, to fund grants to competent professional ethical law enforcement contractors and to hire people directly to engage in protecting the franchise, protecting the nice volunteers and the mission of serving readers. --<a href="/wiki/User:Doncram" title="User:Doncram"><font color="maroon">do</font></a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Doncram" title="User talk:Doncram"><font color="green">ncr</font></a><a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/doncram" title="Special:Contributions/doncram"><font color="maroon">am</font></a> 20:28, 8 May 2017 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

I'm sure we've all read an article about Wikipedia and smiled at the lack of knowledge of the author. This isn't quite in that same mold. The author claims to have done a fair amount of research, yet makes error after error after error. If it were merely full of multiple errors, that would beg for education rather than humiliation, but it goes well beyond that. Some of her claims are "merely" over the top (she claims to have read every single rule in Wikipedia) but she's doesn't simply identify flaws, she actively promotes violation of our rules. She isn't simply advising people how to get around a bit of a bureaucracy, she is actively promoting an approach which would undermine what we stand for.

Borrowing from <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/fraud">[3]</a></dd>
<dd>"Fraud must be proved by showing that the defendant's actions involved five separate elements: (1) a false statement of a material fact,(2) knowledge on the part of the defendant that the statement is untrue, (3) intent on the part of the defendant to deceive the alleged victim, (4) justifiable reliance by the alleged victim on the statement, and (5) injury to the alleged victim as a result. Note that "lying by omission" can be considered to be a "false statement" in some cases, e.g. "Sorry I forget to tell you that the house I sold you is built on a toxic waste dump."</dd>
<dd>If the "lying by omission" applies here - and declaring that you are a paid editor is required by the ToU - then all 5 elements are there as shown in the Entrepreneur article and the fact that "her"article lasted 6 months, for point 4. (No I'm not really a lawyer). Note that I do think it is important for several reasons to ask somebody that you suspect of being an undeclared paid editor if he is. 1st he might be able to explain why you're mistaken, 2nd, it's no longer "lying by omission" if an undeclared paid editor states that he isn't one, it's just plain lying. 3rd he might re-examine his actions at that point. ....</dd>
<dd>Some people seem to not understand the "theft" part "(5) injury to the alleged victim as a result."  The use of a webpage (for advertising or otherwise) is property, owned by the WMF in this case.  If Osmond Marketing really, really wanted to use a page for an ad, then they could contact the owner (the WMF) and arrange to pay for its use. Just because the owner doesn't want to sell doesn't make it any less "property."  It also injures our reputation and can injure our readers e.g. in the <a href="/wiki/Banc_De_Binary" title="Banc De Binary">Banc De Binary</a> case.</dd>

Frankly the inaction by the WMF on this issue is surprising. <a href="/wiki/User:Mr_Ernie" title="User:Mr Ernie">Mr Ernie</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Mr_Ernie" title="User talk:Mr Ernie">talk</a>) 16:04, 9 May 2017 (UTC)
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>I'm not exactly sure what you are accusing me of, but the header of main section here is just the the title of the article in <i>Entrepreneur.</i> If you can find some rule that prevents me from doing that, please just list it below.  It strikes me that you might be proposing that folks who recommend to their readers in an off-Wiki site that they break Wikipedia's rules and ToU must be left completely unanswered off-Wiki, but that Wikipedia editors who want Wikipedia's rules to be followed may not post anything about that off-Wiki.  A complete double standard. Or are you trying to censor me on Jimbo's talk page?  If so, just ask Jimmy to request that I not post on this subject on his talk page.  I will follow his wishes on the matter.  <a href="/wiki/User:Smallbones" title="User:Smallbones">Smallbones</a><sub>(<font color="cc6600"><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Smallbones" title="User talk:Smallbones">smalltalk</a></font>)</sub> 17:23, 9 May 2017 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>
<dd>Upwork isn't really our primary target in this; I have a distaste for the modern practice of viewing corporate monopoly as a natural condition that should be exploited to make companies the nannies of the serfs they supervise.  But even so, they may be the <i>clients' </i>primary target.</dd>
<dd>The first thing to understand is that the BLP subject, even a sleazy corporation, is a victim here.  They get their reputation trashed in news exposes because they paid for work they usually could have convinced someone to do for free.</dd>
<dd>Once we have the victim identified, who is the criminal?  Well, that's the person who puts out his shingle as a professional Wiki contractor when in fact he's a fly-by-night vandal who is defying the site's Terms of Service and leaving his clients' name in the mud when he finishes.  But that's not our cause of action - it's the client's cause of action.</dd>
<dd>Now if something like this happened, a company like Upwork's position would be simple enough: as a client, you're saying you turned to them for Wiki contractors, and they gave you flim-flam men who didn't even follow the site TOS.  I imagine you must have to sign away every right known to man to hire contractors on any freelancing site, but legal matters are never predictable, and there's always the court of public opinion.  Even if such a dispute merely leads to an unproductive lawsuit ... the contractor probably had to sign something even worse with Upwork, which lands indemnity for any and all court costs at his doorstep.</dd>
<dd>So Upwork and other freelancing sites aren't really a target, but they are potentially a medium, but first we have to identify the right person to act, who is the <i>subject</i> of the article.  Only by acting as an alliance can Wikipedia and a wronged article subject act together to crack down on the stealth paid editing marketplace. <a href="/wiki/User:Wnt" title="User:Wnt">Wnt</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Wnt" title="User talk:Wnt">talk</a>) 16:34, 9 May 2017 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Upwork is certainly not the target, it is just a medium.  But the advertiser, usually the company who initiates the advert on Upwork, which then results in an advert for the company on Wikipedia, is not the victim.  Using your words, it is the "criminal." Wikipedians certainly have a cause-of-action.  The companies are effectively stealing advertising on Wikipedia and degrading our reputation. <a href="/wiki/User:Smallbones" title="User:Smallbones">Smallbones</a><sub>(<font color="cc6600"><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Smallbones" title="User talk:Smallbones">smalltalk</a></font>)</sub> 17:32, 9 May 2017 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>
<dd>The recommendation of using those sites deceptively is one of the most disturbing parts of the <i>Entrepreneur</i> article.  We can shut down the deceptive use of those sites, with minimal cooperation by the sites, if we are willing to take the bull by the horns.

<ul><li>Note that we are not dictating to anybody what they have to do on Fiver or any other off-Wiki website.

<li>check if the Wikipedia user page has the required positing about bidding on Fiver</li></ul></s><s><dl><dd>That's avery simple process that doesn't require any detailed knowledge of Wikipedia policy or making any fine distinctions.

You can <a class="external text" href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/maniphest/task/edit/form/1/?projects=Cite,VisualEditor,Wikimedia-Site-requests&amp;title=Convert%20reference%20lists%20over%20to%20`responsive`%20on%20XXwiki&amp;priority=10&amp;parent=159895"><b>request multi-column support</b></a> for your wiki. <a class="external autonumber" href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T33597">[7]</a>
</p><p>Other changes:
</p></s><s><ul><li>You can now use your web browser's function to switch typing direction in the new wikitext mode. This is particularly helpful for RTL language users like Urdu or Hebrew who have to write JavaScript or CSS. You can use Command+Shift+X or Control+Shift+X to trigger this. <a class="external autonumber" href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T153356">[8]</a></li>
<li>The way to switch between the visual editing mode and the wikitext editing mode is now consistent. There is a drop-down menu that shows the two options. This is now the same in desktop and mobile web editing, and inside things that embed editing, such as Flow. <a class="external autonumber" href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T116417">[9]</a></li>
<li>The Categories item has been moved to the top of the Page options menu (from clicking on the  <a href="/wiki/File:VisualEditor_-_Icon_-_Menu.svg" class="image"><img alt="&quot;hamburger&quot;" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/VisualEditor_-_Icon_-_Menu.svg/24px-VisualEditor_-_Icon_-_Menu.svg.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/VisualEditor_-_Icon_-_Menu.svg/36px-VisualEditor_-_Icon_-_Menu.svg.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/VisualEditor_-_Icon_-_Menu.svg/48px-VisualEditor_-_Icon_-_Menu.svg.png 2x" data-file-width="24" data-file-height="24" /></a> icon) for quicker access. <a class="external autonumber" href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T74399">[10]</a> There is also now a "Templates used on this page" feature there. <a class="external autonumber" href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T149009">[11]</a></li>
<li>You can now create <code>&lt;chem&gt;</code>  tags (sometimes used as <code>&lt;ce&gt;</code>) for chemical formulas inside the visual editor. <a class="external autonumber" href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T153365">[12]</a></li>
<li>Tables can be set as collapsed or un-collapsed. <a class="external autonumber" href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T157989">[13]</a></li>
<li>The Special character menu now includes characters for Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics and angle quotation marks (‹› and ⟨⟩) .  The team thanks the volunteer developer, <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/en:User:Tpt" class="extiw" title="s:en:User:Tpt">Tpt</a>. <a class="external autonumber" href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T108626">[14]</a></li>
<li>A bug caused some section edit conflicts to blank the rest of the page.  This has been fixed.  The team are sorry for the disruption. <a class="external autonumber" href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T154217">[15]</a></li>
<li>There is a new keyboard shortcut for citations:  <code>Control</code>+<code>Shift</code>+<code>K</code> on a PC, or <code>Command</code>+<code>Shift</code>+<code>K</code> on a Mac.  It is based on the keyboard shortcut for making links, which is <code>Control</code>+<code>K</code> on a PC or <code>Command</code>+<code>K</code> on a Mac. <a class="external autonumber" href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T99299">[16]</a></li></ul></s><s><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Future_changes">Future changes</span></h3></s><s><ul><li>The VisualEditor team is working with the Community Tech team on a syntax highlighting tool.  It will highlight matching pairs of <code>&lt;ref&gt;</code> tags and other types of wikitext syntax.  You will be able to turn it on and off.  It will first become available in VisualEditor's built-in wikitext mode, maybe late in 2017. <a class="external autonumber" href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T101246">[17]</a></li>
<li>The kind of button used to Show preview, Show changes, and finish an edit will change in all WMF-supported wikitext editors.  The new buttons will use <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/OOjs_UI" class="extiw" title="mw:OOjs UI">OOjs UI</a>.  The buttons will be larger, brighter, and easier to read.  The labels will remain the same.  You can test the new button by editing a page and adding <code>&amp;ooui=1</code> to the end of the URL, like this:  <a class="external free" href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Project:Sandbox?action=edit&amp;ooui=1">https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Project:Sandbox?action=edit&amp;ooui=1</a>  The old appearance will no longer be possible, even with local CSS changes.  <a class="external autonumber" href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T162849">[18]</a></li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/File:Edit_toolbar_-_2.png" class="extiw" title="mw:File:Edit toolbar - 2.png">outdated 2006 wikitext editor</a> will be removed later this year.  It is used by approximately 0.03% of active editors.  See <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Editor" class="extiw" title="mw:Editor">a list of editing tools on mediawiki.org</a> if you are uncertain which one you use.  <a class="external autonumber" href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T30856">[19]</a></li></ul></s><s><p>If you aren't reading this in your preferred language, then please help us with translations!
