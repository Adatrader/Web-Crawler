the author or his assignees, of multiplying for sale copies of an
original work or composition, in literature or art. As a recognized
form of property it is, compared with others, of recent origin,
being in fact, in the use of literary works, mainly the result of the
facility for multiplying copies created by the discovery of printing.
It is with copyright in literary compositions that we are here
primarily concerned, as it was established first, the analogous
right as regards works of plastic art, &amp;c., following in its train.
</p><p>1. Whether copyright was recognized at all by the common
law of England was long a much debated legal question. Blackstone
thinks that “this species of property, being grounded on
labour and invention, is more properly reducible to the head of
occupancy than any other, since the right of occupancy itself
is supposed by Mr Locke and many others to be founded on the
personal labour of the occupant.” But he speaks doubtfully of
its existence—merely mentioning the opposing views, “that
on the one hand it hath been thought no other man can have a
right to exhibit the author’s work without his consent, and that
it is urged on the other hand that the right is of too subtle and
unsubstantial a nature to become the subject of property at
the common law, and only capable of being guarded by positive
statutes and special provisions of the magistrate.” He notices
that the <a href="/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Roman_Law" title="1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Roman Law">Roman law</a> adjudged that if one man wrote anything
on the paper or parchment of another, the writing should belong
to the owner of the blank materials, but as to any other property
in the works of the understanding the law is silent, and he adds
that “neither with us in England hath there been (till very lately)
any final determination upon the rights of authors at the common
law.” The common law undoubtedly gives a right to restrain
the publication of <i>unpublished</i> compositions; but when a work
is once published, its protection depends on the statutes regulating
copyright. The leading case on the subject of unpublished
works is <a href="/w/index.php?title=Prince_Albert_v._Strange&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Prince Albert v. Strange (page does not exist)"><i>Prince Albert</i> v. <i>Strange</i></a> (1849), 2 De G. &amp; Sm. 652.
Copies of etchings by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, which
had been lithographed for private circulation, fell into the hands
of the defendant, a London publisher, who proposed to exhibit
them, and issued a catalogue entitled <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=A_Descriptive_Catalogue_of_the_Royal_Victoria_and_Albert_Gallery_of_Etchings&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="A Descriptive Catalogue of the Royal Victoria and Albert Gallery of Etchings (page does not exist)">A Descriptive Catalogue of the Royal Victoria and Albert Gallery of Etchings</a></i>. The court
of chancery restrained the publication of the catalogue, holding
that property in mechanical works, or works of art, does certainly
subsist, and is invaded, before publication, not only by copying
but by description or catalogue. This protection includes news
(<a href="/w/index.php?title=Exchange_Telegraph_Co._v._Central_News&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Exchange Telegraph Co. v. Central News (page does not exist)">Exchange Telegraph Co.<i> v. </i>Central News,<i></i></a>, 1897).
</p><p>As a matter of principle, the nature of copyright itself, and the
reasons why it should be recognized in law, have, as already
stated, been the subject of bitter dispute. It was
attacked as constituting a monopoly, and it has been
<span style="text-align: left; width: 6em; float: left; padding: 0.4em 0.8em 0.4em 0em; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; font-size: 85%; line-height: 1.3em;">Nature of right.</span>
argued that copyright should be looked upon as a
doubtful exception to the general law regulating trade, and should
be strictly limited in point of duration. On the other hand, it is
claimed that copyright, being in the nature of personal property,
should be perpetual. A man’s own work, in this view, is as much
<i>his</i> as his house or his money, and should be protected by the
state. Historically, and in legal definition, there would appear
to be no doubt that copyright, as regulated by statute, is strictly
a monopoly. The parliamentary protection of works of art for
the period of fourteen years by an act of 1709 and later statutes
appears, as Blackstone points out, to have been suggested by
the exception in the Statute of Monopolies 1623. The object of
that statute was to suppress the royal grants of exclusive right to
trade in certain articles, and to reassert in relation to all such
monopolies the common law of the land. Certain exceptions
were made on grounds of public policy, and among others it was
allowed that a royal patent of privilege might be granted for
fourteen years “to any inventor of a new manufacture for the
sole working or making of the same.” Copyright, like patent
right, would be covered by the legal definition of a monopoly.
It is a mere right to prevent other people from manufacturing
certain articles. But objections to monopolies in general do
not apply to this particular class of cases, in which the author
of a new work in literature or art has the right of preventing
others from manufacturing copies thereof and selling them to
the public. The rights of persons licensed to sell spirits, to hold
theatrical exhibitions, &amp;c., are also of the nature of monopolies,
and may be defended on special grounds of public policy. The
monopoly of authors and inventors rests on the general sentiment
underlying all civilized law, that a man should be protected in
the enjoyment of the fruits of his own labour.

of publication still has certain historical results.
A special kind of what amounts to perpetual copyright in various
publications has for various reasons been recognized by the laws
(1) in the crown, and (2) in the universities and colleges. The
various copyright acts, referred to below, except from their
provisions the copyrights vested in the two English and the four
Scottish universities, Trinity College, Dublin, and the colleges of
Eton, Westminster and Winchester. Crown copyrights are saved
by the general principle which exempts crown rights from the
operation of statutes unless they are expressly mentioned.
Among the books in which the crown has claimed copyright are
the English translation of the <a href="/wiki/Bible" class="mw-disambig" title="Bible">Bible</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Book_of_Common_Prayer_(1892)" title="Book of Common Prayer (1892)">Book of Common Prayer</a>,
statutes, orders of privy council, proclamations, almanacs,
Lilly’s <a href="/w/index.php?title=Latin_Grammar&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Latin Grammar (page does not exist)">Latin Grammar</a>, year books and law reports. The copyright
in the Bible is rested by some on the king’s position as head of the church; Lord Lyndhurst rested it on his duties as the chief  executive officer of the state charged with the publication of authorized manuals of religion. The right of printing the Bible and the Book of Common Prayer is vested in the king’s printer and the universities of Oxford and Cambridge. These copyrights do not extend to prohibit independent translations from the original. The obsolete copyright of the crown in Lilly’s Latin Grammar was founded on the fact of its having been drawn up at the king’s expense. The universities have a joint right (with the crown’s patentees) of printing acts of <span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed red;" title="amended from &#39;parliment&#39;">parliament</span>. Law reports were decided to be the property of the crown in the reign of Charles II.; by act of parliament they were forbidden
&#32;<span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="119" data-page-number="119" title="Page:EB1911_-_Volume_07.djvu/136">&#8203;</span></span>
to be published without licence from the chancellor and the chiefs of the three courts, and this form of licence remained in use after the act had expired. University and college copyrights were made perpetual by an act of George III., but only on condition of the books being printed at their printing presses and for their own benefit.
</p><p>3. The first definite statute, or Copyright Act, in England was
passed in 1709. The preamble states that printers, booksellers
and other persons were frequently in the habit of printing,
reprinting, and publishing “books and other writings without
the consent of the authors or proprietors of such books and
writings, to their very great detriment, and too often to the
ruin of them and their families.” “For preventing, therefore, such
practices for the future, and for the encouragement of learned
men to compose and write useful books, it is enacted that the
author of any book or books already printed, who hath not
transferred to any other the copy or copies of such book or books
in order to print or reprint the same, shall have the sole right and
liberty of printing such book or books for the term of one-and-twenty
years, and that the author of any book or books already
composed, and not printed and published, or that shall hereafter
be composed, and his assignee, or assignees, shall have the sole
liberty of printing and reprinting such book or books for the term
of fourteen years, to commence from the day of first publishing
the same, and no longer.” The penalty for offences against the
act was declared to be the forfeiture of the illicit copies to the
true proprietor, and the fine of one penny per sheet, half to the
crown, and half to any person suing for the same. “After the
expiration of the said term of fourteen years the sole right of
printing or disposing of copies shall return to the authors thereof,
if they are then living, or their representatives, for another term
of fourteen years.” To secure the benefit of the act registration
at Stationers’ Hall was necessary. In section 4 was contained
the provision that if any person thought the price of a book
“too high and unreasonable,” he might complain to the archbishop
of Canterbury, the lord chancellor, the bishop of London,
the chiefs of the three courts at Westminster, and the vice-chancellors
of the two universities in England, and to the lord
president, lord justice general, lord chief baron of the exchequer,
and the rector of the college of Edinburgh in Scotland, who might
fix a reasonable price. Nine copies of each book were to be provided
for the royal library, the libraries of the universities of
Oxford and Cambridge, the four Scottish <span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed red;" title="amended from &#39;universites&#39;">universities</span>, Sion
College, and the faculty of advocates at Edinburgh.
</p><p>It was believed for a long time that this statute had not
interfered with the rights of authors at common law. Ownership
of literary property at common law appears indeed to have been
recognized in some earlier statutes. The <a href="/w/index.php?title=Licensing_Act_1662&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Licensing Act 1662 (page does not exist)">Licensing Act 1662</a>
prohibited the printing of any work without the consent of the
<i>owner</i> on pain of forfeiture, &amp;c. This act expired in 1679, and
attempts to renew it were unsuccessful. The records of the
Stationers’ Company show that the purchase and sale of copyrights
had become an established usage, and the loss of the protection,
incidentally afforded by the Licensing Act, was felt as a
serious grievance, which ultimately led to the statute of 1709.
That statute, as the judges in <a href="/w/index.php?title=Millar_v._Taylor&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Millar v. Taylor (page does not exist)"><i>Millar</i> v. <i>Taylor</i></a> (1769, 4 Burr.
2303) pointed out, speaks of the ownership of literary property
as a known thing. Many cases are recorded in which the courts
protected copyrights not falling within the periods laid down
by the act. Thus in 1735 the master of the rolls restrained the
printing of an edition of the <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Whole_Duty_of_Man&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Whole Duty of Man (page does not exist)">Whole Duty of Man</a></i>, published in
1657. In 1739 an injunction was granted by Lord Hardwicke
against the publication of <i><a href="/wiki/Paradise_Lost" class="mw-disambig" title="Paradise Lost">Paradise Lost</a></i>, at the instance of persons
claiming under an assignment from Milton in 1667. In the case
of <i>Millar</i> v. <i>Taylor</i> the plaintiff, who had purchased the copyright
of Thomson’s <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Seasons&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Seasons (page does not exist)">Seasons</a></i> in 1729, claimed damages for an
unlicensed publication thereof by the defendant in 1763. The
jury found that before the statute it was usual to purchase from
authors the perpetual copyright of their works. Three judges,
among whom was Lord Mansfield, decided in favour of the
common law right; one was of the contrary opinion. The
majority thought that the act of 1709 was not intended to destroy
copyright at common law, but merely to protect it more efficiently
during the limited periods. <i>Millar</i> v. <i>Taylor</i>, however, was
speedily overruled by the case of <i>Donaldson</i> v. <i>Beckett</i> in the
House of Lords in 1774. The judges were called upon to state
their opinions. A majority (seven to four) were of opinion that
the author and his assigns had at common law the sole right
of publication in perpetuity. A majority (six to five) were of
opinion that this right had been taken away by the statute of
1709, and a term of years substituted for the perpetuity. The
decision appears to have taken the trade by surprise. Many
booksellers had purchased copyrights not protected by the
statute, and they now petitioned parliament to be relieved
from the consequences of the decision in <i>Donaldson</i> v. <i>Beckett</i>.
A bill for this purpose actually passed the House of Commons,
but Lord Camden’s influence succeeded in defeating it in the
House of Lords. The result is that from that time on ordinary
copyright has been recognized except in so far as it is sanctioned
by statute. The university copyrights were, however, protected
in perpetuity by an act passed in 1775.
</p><p>By an act of 1801 the penalty for infringement of copyright
was increased to threepence per sheet, in addition to the forfeiture
of the book. The proprietor was to have an action on the case
against any person in the United Kingdom, or British dominions
in Europe, who should print, reprint, or import without the
consent of the proprietor, first had in writing, signed in the
presence of two or more credible witnesses, any book or books, or
who knowing them to be printed, &amp;c., without the proprietor’s
consent should sell, publish, or expose them for sale; the
proprietor to have his damages as assessed by the jury, and
double costs of suit. A second period of fourteen years was
confirmed to the author, should he still be alive at the end of the
first. Further, it was forbidden to import into the United
Kingdom for sale books first composed, written, or printed and
published within the United Kingdom, and reprinted elsewhere.
Another change was made by the act of 1814, which in substitution
for the two periods of fourteen years gave to the author and
his assignees copyright for the full term of twenty-eight years
from the date of the first publication, “and also, if the author be
living at the end of that period, for the residue of his natural life.”
</p><p>4. The Copyright Act of 1842 repealed the previous acts on the
same subject, and is the basis of the existing law. Its preamble
stated its object to be to encourage the production of
“literary matter of lasting benefit to the world.” The
<span style="text-align: left; width: 6em; float: left; padding: 0.4em 0.8em 0.4em 0em; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; font-size: 85%; line-height: 1.3em;">Act of<br />1842.</span>
principal clause is the following (§ 3): “That the copyright
in every book which shall after the passing of this act be
published in the lifetime of its author shall endure for the natural
life of such author, and for the further term of seven years,
commencing at the time of his death, and shall be the property of
such author and his assignees; provided always that if the said
term of seven years shall expire before the end of forty-two years
from the first publication of such book the copyright shall in that
case endure for such period of forty-two years; and that the
copyright of every book which shall be published after the death
of its author shall endure for the term of forty-two years from the
first publication thereof, and shall be the property of the proprietor
of the author’s manuscript from which such book shall be
first published and his assigns.” The benefit of the enlarged period
was extended to subsisting copyrights, unless they were the
property of an assignee who had acquired them by purchase, in
which case the period of copyright would be extended only if the
author or his personal representative agreed with the proprietor
to accept the benefit of the act. By section 5 the judicial
committee of the privy council may license the republication of
books which the proprietor of the copyright thereof refuses to
publish after the death of the author. The sixth section provides
for the delivery within certain times of copies of all books
published after the passing of the act, and of all subsequent
editions thereof, at the British Museum. And a copy of every
book and its subsequent editions must be sent <i>on demand</i> to the
following libraries: the Bodleian at Oxford, the public library at
Cambridge, the library of the faculty of advocates in Edinburgh,
and that of Trinity College, Dublin. Other libraries (the libraries&#32;<span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="120" data-page-number="120" title="Page:EB1911_-_Volume_07.djvu/137">&#8203;</span></span>
of the four Scottish Universities, King’s Inns, Dublin, and Sion
College) entitled to this privilege under the earlier acts had been
deprived thereof by an act passed in 1836, and grants from the
treasury, calculated on the annual average value of the books
they had received, were ordered to be paid to them as compensation.
A book of registry is ordered to be kept at Stationers’ Hall
for the registration of copyrights, to be open to inspection on
payment of one shilling for every entry which shall be searched
for or inspected. And the officer of Stationers’ Hall shall give a
certified copy of any entry when required, on payment of five
shillings; and such certified copies shall be received in evidence
in the courts as prima facie proof of proprietorship or assignment
of copyright or licence as therein expressed, and, in the case of
dramatic or musical pieces, of the right of representation or
performance. False entries shall be punished as misdemeanours.
The entry is to record the title of the book, the time of its publication,
and the name and place of abode of the publisher and
proprietor of copyright. Without making such entry no proprietor
can bring an action for infringement of his copyright, but
the entry is not otherwise to affect the copyright itself. Any
person deeming himself aggrieved by an entry in the registry may
complain to one of the superior courts, which will order it to be
expunged or varied if necessary. A proprietor may bring an
action on the case for infringement of his copyright, and the
defendant in such an action must give notice of the objections to
the plaintiff’s title on which he means to rely. No person except
the proprietor of the copyright is allowed to import into the
British dominions for sale or hire any book first composed or
written or printed and published in the United Kingdom, and
reprinted elsewhere, under penalty of forfeiture and a fine of £10.
The proprietor of any encyclopaedia, review, magazine, periodical
work, or work published in a series of books or parts, who shall
have employed any person to compose the same, or any volumes,
parts, essays, articles, or portions thereof, for publication on the
terms that the copyright therein shall belong to such proprietor,
shall enjoy the term of copyright granted by the act.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> But the
proprietor may not publish separately any article or review
without the author’s consent, nor may the author unless he has
reserved the right of separate publication. Where neither party
has reserved the right they may publish by agreement, but the
author at the end of twenty-eight years may publish separately.
Proprietors of periodical works shall be entitled to all the benefits
of registration under the act, on entering in the registry the title,
the date of first publication of the first volume or part, and the
names of proprietor and publisher.
</p><p>The interpretation clause of the act defines a book to be every
volume, part, or division of a volume, pamphlet, sheet of letter-press,
sheet of music, map, chart, or plan separately published.
</p><p>5. During the last quarter of the 19th century the question of
copyright became continually more prominent, and a considerable
extension was given by judicial interpretation to the
scope of the act of 1842. “Literary matter of lasting <span style="text-align: left; width: 6em; float: left; padding: 0.4em 0.8em 0.4em 0em; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; font-size: 85%; line-height: 1.3em;">Recent extensions.</span>
benefit to the world” came to include every publication
(not being illegal) which could be described as
“literary” or “original,” the criterion as to the latter qualification
being, in the last resort, whether (see <a href="/w/index.php?title=Trade_Auxiliary_Co._v._Middlesborough_Association&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Trade Auxiliary Co. v. Middlesborough Association (page does not exist)"><i>Trade Auxiliary Co. </i> v. <i>Middlesborough Association</i></a>,
1889, 40 Ch.D. 425) the author
or compiler has really put his own brain-work into it.
</p><p>6. The most marked and certain progress has been in the
application of the law of copyright to the periodical press, in
order to protect within reasonable limits the labour
and expenditure of newspapers that obtain for the <span style="text-align: left; width: 6em; float: left; padding: 0.4em 0.8em 0.4em 0em; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; font-size: 85%; line-height: 1.3em;">Newspapers.</span>
public the earliest news and arrange it for publication.
It is settled law since 1881 (<i>Walter</i> v. <i>Howe</i>, 17 Ch.D. 708, overruling
<a href="/w/index.php?title=Cox_v._Land_%26_Water_Journal_Co.&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Cox v. Land &amp; Water Journal Co. (page does not exist)"><i>Cox</i> v. <i>Land &amp; Water Journal Co.</i></a>, 1869), that a newspaper
is a book within the meaning of the act, and can claim all rights
that a book has under the Copyright Act. Thus, leading articles,
special articles, and even news items are protected (<i>Walter</i> v.
<i>Steinkopff</i>, 1892, 3 Ch. 489; <i>Exchange Telegraph Co.</i> v. <i>Gregory</i>
<i>and Co.</i>, 1896, 1 Q.B. 147). Current prices of stocks and shares,
translations, the compilation of a directory, summaries of legal
proceedings, and other similar literary work, so far as the literary
form, the labour and money are concerned, are equally protected.
In short, the test may now be broadly stated to be, whether
labour of the brain and expenditure of money have been given
for the production; whilst the old requirement of original
matter is very broadly interpreted. The leading case on the
subject is <i>Walter</i> v. <i>Lane</i> (decided in the House of Lords, 6th
August 1900). The question there raised was, whether or not
copyright applied under the act of 1842 in respect of <i>verbatim</i>
reports of speeches. Four law lords, viz. Lord Chancellor
Halsbury, Lord Davey, Lord James of Hereford and Lord
Brampton upheld the claim to copyright in such cases, whilst
Lord Robertson was the sole dissentient.
</p><p>Apart from newspapers, protection has been extended to
publications having no literary character; Messrs Maple’s
furniture catalogue, and the Stock Exchange prices on the “tape”
have been awarded the same protection as directories. The
courts have declined to protect works which are mere copies
of railway time-tables, or the “tips” of a sporting prophet, or
mechanical devices with no independent literary matter, such
as patterns for cutting ladies’ sleeves.
</p><p>7. The publication of lectures without consent of the authors
or their assignees is prohibited by the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Lecture_Copyright_Act_1835&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Lecture Copyright Act 1835 (page does not exist)">Lecture Copyright Act 1835</a>,
which reinforces the common law against publication
of “unpublished” matter, and gives a copyright <span style="text-align: left; width: 6em; float: left; padding: 0.4em 0.8em 0.4em 0em; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; font-size: 85%; line-height: 1.3em;">Lectures.</span>
for 28 years. This act, however, excepts from its provisions:
(1) lectures of which notice has not been given two days before
their delivery to two justices of the peace living within 5 m.
to the place of delivery (an impracticable condition), and (2)
lectures delivered in universities and other public institutions.
Sermons by clergy of the established Church are believed to fall
within this exception. The leading cases are <i>Nicols</i> v. <i>Pitman</i>,
1884, 26 Ch.D. 374, and <i>Caird</i> v. <i>Sime</i>, 1887, 12 A.C. 326.
</p><p>8. The writer of private letters sent to another person may
in general restrain their publication. It was urged in some of
the cases that the sender had abandoned his property
in the letter by the act of sending; but this was denied <span style="text-align: left; width: 6em; float: left; padding: 0.4em 0.8em 0.4em 0em; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; font-size: 85%; line-height: 1.3em;">Private letters.</span>
by Lord Hardwicke (<i>Pope</i> v. <i>Curl</i> in 1741), who held
that at most the receiver only might take some kind of joint
property in the letter along with the author. Judge Story, in
the American case of <i>Folsom</i> v. <i>Marsh</i>, 2 Story (Amer.) 100,
states the law as follows: “The author of any letter or letters,
and his representatives, whether they are literary letters or
letters of business, possess the sole and exclusive copyright
therein; and no person, neither those to whom they are addressed,
nor other persons, have any right or authority to publish the
same upon their own account or for their own benefit.” But
there may be special occasions justifying such publication. See
also the English case of <i>Macmillan</i> v. <i>Dent</i> (1905).
</p><p>9. The question of what is an infringement of copyright has
been the subject of much discussion. It was decided under the
statute of 1709 that a repetition from memory was
not a publication so as to be an infringement of <span style="text-align: left; width: 6em; float: left; padding: 0.4em 0.8em 0.4em 0em; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; font-size: 85%; line-height: 1.3em;">Test of infringement.</span>
copyright. In the case of <i>Reade</i> v. <i>Conquest</i>, 1861,
9 C.B., the same view was taken. The defendant had
dramatized the plaintiff’s novel <i>It’s Never too Late to Mend</i>,
and the piece was performed at his theatre. This was held to
be no breach of copyright; but the circulation of copies of a
drama, so taken from a copyright novel, whether gratuitously or
for sale, is not allowed. Then again it is often a difficult question
to decide whether the alleged piratical copyright does more than
make that fair use of the original author’s materials which the law
permits. It is not every act of borrowing literary matter from
another which is piracy, and the difficulty is to draw the line
between what is fair and what is unfair. Lord Eldon put the
question thus,—whether the second publication is a legitimate
use of the other in the fair exercise of a mental operation deserving
the character of an original work. Another test proposed is
“whether you find on the part of the defendant an <i>animus</i>
<i>furandi</i>—an intention to take for the purpose of saving himself&#32;<span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="121" data-page-number="121" title="Page:EB1911_-_Volume_07.djvu/138">&#8203;</span></span>
labour.” No one, it has been said, has a right to take, whether
with or without acknowledgment, a material and substantial
portion of another’s work, his arguments, his illustrations, his
authorities, for the purpose of <span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed red;" title="amended from makinng">making</span> or improving a rival
publication. When the materials are open to all, an author may
acquire copyright in his selection or arrangement of them.
Several cases have arisen on this point between the publishers
of rival directories. Here it has been held that the subsequent
compiler is bound to do for himself what the original compiler had
done. When the materials are thus <i>in medio</i>, as the phrase is, it is
considered a fair test of piracy to examine whether the mistakes
of both works are the same. If they are, piracy will be inferred.
Translations stand to each other in the same relation as books
constructed of materials in common. The <i>animus furandi</i>,
mentioned above as a test of piracy, does not imply deliberate
intention to steal; it may be quite compatible with ignorance
even of the copyright work. Abridgments, moreover, of
original works appear to be favoured by the courts—when the
act of abridgment is itself an act of the understanding,
“employed in carrying a large work into a smaller compass, and
rendering it less expensive.” Lord Hatherley, however, in
<i>Tinsley</i> v. <i>Lacy</i>, 1863, 1 H. &amp; M. 747, incidentally expressed his
disapproval of this feeling—holding that the courts had gone
far enough in this direction, and that it was difficult to acquiesce
in the reason sometimes given that the compiler of an abridgment
is a benefactor to mankind by assisting in the diffusion of
knowledge. A mere selection or compilation, so as to bring
the materials into smaller space, will not be a bona fide abridgment;
“there must be real substantial condensation, and
intellectual labour, and judgment bestowed thereon” (Justice
Story). A publication professing to be <i>A Christmas Ghost Story,</i>
<i>Reoriginated from the Original by Charles Dickens, Esq., and</i>
<i>Analytically Condensed expressly for this Work</i>, was found
(<i>Dickens</i> v. <i>Lee</i>, 1844, 8 Jur. 183) to be an invasion of Charles
Dickens’s copyright in the original.
</p><p>10. There can be no copyright in any but innocent publications.
Books of an immoral or irreligious tendency have been
repeatedly decided to be incapable of being made the
subject of copyright. In a case (<i>Lawrence</i> v. <i>Smith</i>,
<span style="text-align: left; width: 6em; float: left; padding: 0.4em 0.8em 0.4em 0em; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; font-size: 85%; line-height: 1.3em;">Injurious works.</span>1 Jac. 471) before Lord Eldon in 1822, an injunction
had been obtained against a pirated publication of the plaintiff’s
<i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Lectures_on_Physiology,_Zoology,_and_the_Natural_History_of_Man&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Lectures on Physiology, Zoology, and the Natural History of Man (page does not exist)">Lectures on Physiology, Zoology, and the Natural History of Man</a></i>,
which the judge refused to continue, “recollecting that the
immortality of the soul is one of the doctrines of the Scriptures,
and considering that the law does not give protection to those
who contradict the Scriptures.” The same judge refused in
1822 to restrain a piracy of Lord Byron’s <i>Cain</i>, and <i>Don Juan</i>
was refused protection in 1823. Compare also <i>Cowan</i> v. <i>Milbourn</i>,
1867, L.R. 2 Ex. 230, in which a contract to let a room for
lectures of an irreligious character was held not to be binding.
</p><p>11. The quasi-copyright in titles of books, periodicals, &amp;c.
is founded on the desirability of preventing one person from
putting off on the public his own productions as those
of another. This is, however, not copyright, but a
<span style="text-align: left; width: 6em; float: left; padding: 0.4em 0.8em 0.4em 0em; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; font-size: 85%; line-height: 1.3em;">Titles of works.</span>
question of ordinary fraud. The name of a journal
(if sufficiently established) is a species of trade-mark in which
the law recognizes what it calls a “species of property,” provided
any misleading of the public is involved. Thus, the <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Wonderful_Magazine&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Wonderful Magazine (page does not exist)">Wonderful Magazine</a></i>
was invaded (1803) by a publication calling itself the
<i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Wonderful_Magazine,_New_Series_Improved&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Wonderful Magazine, New Series Improved (page does not exist)">Wonderful Magazine, New Series Improved</a></i>. <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Bell%27s_Life_in_London&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Bell&#39;s Life in London (page does not exist)">Bell’s Life in London</a></i> was pirated (1859) by a paper calling itself the <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Penny_Bell%27s_Life&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Penny Bell&#39;s Life (page does not exist)">Penny Bell’s Life</a></i>.
The proprietors of the <i>London Journal</i> got an
injunction (1859) against the <i>Daily London Journal</i>, which was
projected by the person from whom they had bought their own
paper, and who had covenanted with them not to publish any
<i>weekly</i> journal of a similar nature. A song published under the
title of <i>Minnie</i>, sung by Madame Anna Thillon and Miss Dolby
at Monsieur Jullien’s concerts, was invaded (1855) by a song to
the same air published as <i>Minnie Dale, Sung at Jullien’s Concerts</i>
<i>by Madame Anna Thillon</i>. On the other hand, the <i>Sphere</i> and
<i>Spear</i>, titles of misleading similarity, assumed by two weekly
periodicals that appeared almost simultaneously in London in
1900, could not successfully attack each other, because neither
had an established reputation when first adopted.
</p><p>12. Dramatic and musical compositions stand on this peculiar
footing, that they may be the subject of two entirely distinct
rights. As writings they come within the general
Copyright Act, and the unauthorized multiplication of
<span style="text-align: left; width: 6em; float: left; padding: 0.4em 0.8em 0.4em 0em; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; font-size: 85%; line-height: 1.3em;">Drama<br />and<br />music.</span>copies is a piracy of the usual sort. This was decided to
be so even in the case of musical compositions under
the act of 1709. The Copyright Act of 1842 includes a “sheet
of music” in its definition of a book. Separate from the copyright
thus existing in dramatic or musical compositions is the
stage-right or right of representing them on the stage; this was
the right created by the Dramatic Copyright Act of 1833, in the
case of dramatic pieces. This act gave the owner of the stage-right
(right of representation) a period of twenty-eight years, or
the duration of the author’s life if longer. The Copyright Act
1842 extended this right to musical compositions, and made the
period in both cases the same as that fixed for copyright. And
the act expressly provides (meeting a contrary decision in the
courts) that the assignment of copyright of dramatic and musical
pieces shall not include the right of representation unless that
is expressly mentioned. The act of 1833 prohibited representation
“at any place of public entertainment,” a phrase which was
omitted in the act of 1842, and it may perhaps be inferred that
the restriction is now more general and would extend to any
unauthorized representation anywhere. A question has also
been raised whether, to obtain the benefit of the act, a musical
piece must be of a dramatic character. The dramatization of a
novel, <i>i.e.</i> the acting of a drama constructed out of materials
derived from a novel, is not necessarily an infringement of the
copyright in the novel (supposing it to be possible to do it without
making any sort of colourable copy of the literary form), but to
publish a drama so constructed has been held to be a breach of
copyright (<i>Tinsley</i> v. <i>Lacy</i>, 1863, 1 H. &amp; M. 747, where defendant
had published two plays founded on two of Miss Braddon’s
novels, and reproducing the incidents and in many cases the
language of the original). Where two persons dramatize the same
novel, what, it may be asked, are their respective rights? In
<i>Toole</i> v. <i>Young</i>, 1874, 9 Q.B. 523, this point actually arose.
A, the author of a published novel, dramatized it and assigned
the drama to the plaintiff, but it was never printed, published
or represented upon the stage. B, ignorant of A’s drama, also
dramatized the novel and assigned his drama to the defendant,
who represented it on the stage. It was held that any one might
dramatize A’s published novel, and that the representation of
B’s drama was not a representation of A’s drama. This case may
be compared with <i>Reade</i> v. <i>Lacy</i> (1861).
</p><p>In the “Little Lord Fauntleroy” case (1888) the person who
dramatized the novel of another without his consent, an operation
up to that time believed to be unassailable in law, was attacked
successfully, by preventing him from using printed or written
copies of the play, either to deposit with the lord chamberlain
or as prompt-books. In every case where much of the original
dialogue of the novel is taken, this stops the production of the
dramatization.
</p><p>In music, statutes of 1882 and 1888 have prevented the use
of the provisions inflicting penalties for the performance of copyright
songs for purposes of extortion, by allowing the court to
inflict a penalty of one farthing and make the plaintiff pay the
costs, if justice requires it. Authors reserving the right of public
performance are required to print a notice to that effect on all
copies of the music.
</p><p>An important decision (which appears to be a grave injustice)
on musical copyright is the case of <i>Boosey</i> v. <i>Whight</i> (1899;
followed in other cases—see <i>Mabe</i> v. <i>Conner</i>, 1909), in which it
was held that the reproduction of copyright tunes on the perforated
slips for an Aeolian or other mechanical instrument
is not an infringement of copyright. In Germany it has been
decided (<i>Lincke</i> v. <i>Gramophone Co.</i>) that the reproduction of
copyright music on a gramophone is an infringement, and an
injunction was granted. It has also been held in France that
the production of copyright <i>words</i> (but not music) was an&#32;<span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="122" data-page-number="122" title="Page:EB1911_-_Volume_07.djvu/139">&#8203;</span></span>
infringement, while in the United States the Copyright Act
of 1909 extended copyright control to mechanical reproductions,
and gave the copyright proprietor power to exact royalties.
</p><p>The copyright in music was subject to serious injury in
England from the selling of pirated copies in the streets by
hawkers; and in 1902 an act was passed enabling summary
proceedings to be taken for having such copies seized and
destroyed. But this act had various practical defects, which
still left publishers largely at the mercy of the pirates. In 1905
the evil had become so serious that the chief music publishers
announced their intention of not producing any further works
till the law was altered; but the new Musical Copyright Bill of
that year was obstructed and talked out in the House of Commons.
In November 1905 an important prosecution, instituted by Messrs
Chappell on behalf of the associated music-publishers and
composers, was brought against a coterie of pirates. In the
session of 1906 another attempt, this time successful, was made
to pass a Musical Copyright Bill. This act (the Musical Copyright
Act 1906) made it a criminal offence, punishable with fine
and imprisonment, to reproduce or sell, or to possess plates for
the production of, pirated copies of musical works. The act also
gave power to a constable to arrest without warrant any person
who in any public place exposes for sale or has in his possession
for sale, or canvasses or personally advertises pirated copies,
provided that the apparent owner of the copyright signs an
authority requesting such arrest at his own risk. Also a court
of summary jurisdiction may grant a search warrant, if there
is reasonable ground for believing that an offence against the act
is being committed on any premises.
</p><p>13. The right of foreigners under the English copyright acts
produced at one time an extraordinary conflict of judicial
opinion. A foreigner who during residence in the
British dominions should publish a work was admitted
<span style="text-align: left; width: 6em; float: left; padding: 0.4em 0.8em 0.4em 0em; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; font-size: 85%; line-height: 1.3em;">Rights of foreigners.</span>
to have a copyright therein. The question was whether
residence at the time of publication was necessary. In <i>Cocks</i> v.
<i>Purday</i>, the court of common pleas held that it was not. In
<i>Boosey</i> v. <i>Davidson</i>, the court of queen’s bench, following the
decision of the court of common pleas in <i>Cocks</i> v. <i>Purday</i>, held
that a foreign author might have copyright in works first published
in England, although he was abroad at the time of publication.
But the court of exchequer, in <i>Boosey</i> v. <i>Purday</i>, refused
to follow these decisions, holding that the legislature intended
only to protect its own subjects,—whether subjects by birth or by
residence. The question came before the House of Lords on
appeal in the case of <i>Boosey</i> v. <i>Jeffreys</i> (1854), in which the
court of exchequer had taken the same line. The judges having
been consulted were found to be divided in opinion. Six of them
held that a foreigner resident abroad might acquire copyright
by publishing first in England. Four maintained the contrary.
The views of the minority were affirmed by the House of Lords
(Lord Chancellor Cranworth and Lords Brougham and St
Leonards). The lord chancellor’s opinion was founded upon
“the general doctrine that a British senate would legislate for
British subjects properly so called, or for such persons who
might obtain that character for a time by being resident in this
country, and therefore under allegiance to the crown, and under
the protection of the laws of England.” Lord Brougham said
that
</p>
<div style="font-size: 92%; line-height: 1.3em">
<p>“The statute of Anne had been passed for the purpose of encouraging
learned men, and with that view that act had given them the
exclusive right in their publications for twenty-one years. This,
however, was clear, they had no copyright at common law, for if
they had there would have been no necessity for the passing of that
statute. It could scarcely be said that the legislature had decided
a century and a half since that act was to be passed to create a
monopoly in literary works solely for the benefit of foreigners. In
the present case he was clearly of opinion that the copyright did
not exist, and therefore that foreign law should not prevail over
British law where there was such diversity between the two.”
</p>
</div>
<p>Against the authority of this case, however, must be set the
opinion of two great lord chancellors—Lord Cairns and Lord
Westbury. In the case of <i>Routledge</i> v. <i>Low</i>, L.R. 3 H. L. 100,
1868, Lord Cairns said,
</p>
<div style="font-size: 92%; line-height: 1.3em">
<p>“The aim of the legislature is to increase the common stock of
the literature of the country; and if that stock can be increased by
the publication for the first time here of a new and valuable work
composed by an alien who has never been in the country, I see
nothing in the wording of the act which prevents, nothing in the
policy of the act which should prevent, and everything in the professed
object of the act and in its wide and general provisions which
should entitle such a person to the protection of the act, in return
and compensation for the addition he has made to the literature of
the country.”
</p>
</div>
<p>And Lord Westbury said, in the same case,
</p>
<div style="font-size: 92%; line-height: 1.3em">
<p>“The case of <i>Jeffreys</i> v. <i>Boosey</i> is a decision which is attached to
and depends on the particular statute of which it was the exponent,
and as that statute had been repealed and is now replaced by another
act, with different enactments expressed in different language,
the case of <i>Jeffreys</i> v. <i>Boosey</i> is not a binding authority in the
exposition of this later statute. The act appears to have been
dictated by a wise and liberal spirit, and in the same spirit it should
be interpreted, adhering of course to the settled rules of legal construction.
The preamble is, in my opinion, quite inconsistent with
the conclusion that the protection given by the statute was intended
to be confined to the works of British authors. The real condition
of obtaining its advantages is the first publication by the author of
his work in the United Kingdom. Nothing renders necessary his
bodily presence here at the time, and I find it impossible to discover
any reason why it should be required, or what it can add to the
merit of the first publication. If the intrinsic merits of the reasoning
on which, <i>Jeffreys</i> v. <i>Boosey</i> was decided be considered, I must
frankly admit that it by no means commands my assent.”
</p>
</div>
<p>These conclusions might follow also from the <a href="/wiki/Naturalization_Act_of_1870" class="mw-redirect mw-disambig" title="Naturalization Act of 1870">Naturalization Act of 1870</a>,
which enacts that real and personal property of
every description may be taken, acquired, held, and disposed
of by an alien in the same manner in all respects as by a natural
born British subject. At the present time the International
Copyright Act has largely removed the question from the area
of conflict.
</p><p>14. <i>International Copyright.</i>—Books published in one country
and circulated in another depend for their protection in the latter
upon international copyright. Until 1886 international
copyright in Great Britain rested on a series of orders
<span style="text-align: left; width: 6em; float: left; padding: 0.4em 0.8em 0.4em 0em; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; font-size: 85%; line-height: 1.3em;">The Bern Convention.</span>in council, made under the authority of the International
Copyright Act 1844 (superseding acts of 1820
and 1826), conferring on the authors of a particular foreign
country the same rights in Great Britain as British authors, on
condition of their registering their work in Great Britain within a
year of first publication abroad. A condition of the granting of
each order was that the sovereign should be satisfied that
reciprocal protection was given in the country in question to
British authors. As the result of conferences at Bern in 1885 and
1887, this system was simplified and made more general by the
treaty known as “The Bern Convention,” signed at Bern on the
5th of September 1887. The contracting parties were the
British Empire, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain,
Switzerland, Tunis and Hayti. Luxemburg, Monaco, Norway
and Japan afterwards joined. Austria and Hungary have a
separate convention with Great Britain, concluded on the 24th of
April 1893. The notable absentees among European powers are
Holland and Russia. So far as the United States is concerned, the
matter is regulated by the American copyright acts, which are
dealt with separately below.
</p><p>The basis of the Bern convention was that authors of any of the
countries of the Union, or the publishers of works first published
in one of them, should enjoy in each of the other countries of the
Union the same rights as the law of that country granted to
native authors. The only conditions were that the work should
comply with the necessary formalities, such as registration, in
the country where it was first published, in which case it was
exempt from all such formalities elsewhere; and that the
protection required from any country should not exceed that
given in the country of origin. The rights conferred included the
sole right of making a translation of the work for ten years from
its first publication. The convention was retrospective; that is
to say, it applied to copyright works published before its coming
into existence, each country being allowed to protect vested
interests, or copies already made by others, as it should think
best.
</p><p>The rights of foreign authors in Great Britain rest on legislation&#32;<span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="123" data-page-number="123" title="Page:EB1911_-_Volume_07.djvu/140">&#8203;</span></span>
giving effect to the Bern convention, namely, the International
Copyright Act of 1886, and an order in council made under that
act, dated 28th November 1887. These confer on the author or
publisher of a work of literature or art first published in one of the
countries which are parties to the convention, after compliance
with the formalities necessary there, the same rights as if the work
had been first published in the United Kingdom, provided that
those rights are not greater than those enjoyed in the foreign
country.
</p><p>The rights of British authors in foreign countries rest in each
country on the domestic legislation by which the particular
country has given effect to its promise contained in the Bern
convention, and are enforced by the courts of that country.
The Bern convention was revised in minor details not affecting its
broad principles by a conference meeting in 1896 in Paris, and
Great Britain adopted the results of their labours by an order in
council dated 7th March 1898. A further simplification in the
international law of copyright was expected to result from the
efforts of the international conference at Berlin in 1908, July 1910
being the latest date at which ratification by the states concerned
might take place, but it cannot here be stated to what extent
legislation may give effect to the decisions arrived at. So far as
these decisions affect Great Britain, the greatest alterations of
existing law would be in establishing throughout the Union
protection of musical copyright, especially with regard to singing
and talking machines, and also in the matter of newspaper
copyright. The conference adopted a threefold division of
newspaper matter: (1) serial stories, tales and all other work,
literary, scientific and artistic, which is to have absolute
protection; (2) all newspaper matter, except the foregoing and
mere items of general news (<i>faits divers</i>), of which reproduction
is to be permitted on acknowledgment of the source, unless such
reproduction is expressly forbidden; (3) news of the day and
simple facts, to which no protection is given. An endeavour was
also made to have a uniform period throughout the Union for
copyright of the author’s life and 50 years.
</p><p>15. <i>Colonial Copyright.</i>—Under English copyright, books of
the United Kingdom were formerly protected in the colonies by
the Colonial Copyright Act of 1847, and copies of them printed or
reprinted elsewhere could not be imported into the colonies. In
1876 a royal commission was appointed to consider the whole
question of home, colonial and international copyright; and
various recommendations were made. But the matter now rests
on the English International Copyright Act 1886, which contains
provisions designed to extend the benefit of the British
copyright acts to works first produced in the colonies, while
allowing each colony to legislate separately for works first
produced within its own limits. The colonies at present are all
included in the system of international copyright established by
the Bern convention.
</p><p>In 1875 an act was passed (re-enacted in 1886 in the revised
Canadian statutes) to give effect to an act of the parliament of the
Dominion of Canada respecting copyright. An order in council
in 1868 had suspended the prohibition against the importation of
foreign reprints of English books into Canada, and the parliament
had passed a bill on the subject of copyright as to which doubts
had arisen whether it was not repugnant to the Order in Council.
It was also enacted that, after the bill came into operation, if an
English copyright book became entitled to Canadian copyright,
no Canadian reprints thereof should be imported into the United
Kingdom, unless by the owner of the copyright. The following
points in the Canadian act are worth noting:—Any person printing
or publishing an unprinted manuscript without the consent
of the author or legal proprietor shall be liable in damages (§ 3).
Any person domiciled in Canada, or in any part of the British
possessions, or being a citizen of any country having an international
copyright treaty with the United Kingdom, who is the
author of any book, map, &amp;c., &amp;c., shall have the sole right and
liberty of printing, reprinting, publishing, &amp;c., for the term of
twenty-eight years. The work must be printed and published, or
reprinted or republished in Canada, whether before or after its
publication elsewhere: and the Canadian privilege is not to be continued
after the copyright has ceased elsewhere. And “no immoral
or licentious, or irreligious, or treasonable, or seditious literary,
scientific or artistic work” shall be the subject of copyright (§ 4).
A further period of fourteen years will be continued to the author
or his widow and children. An “interim copyright” pending
publication may be obtained by depositing in the office of the
minister of agriculture (who keeps the register of copyrights) a
copy of the title of the work; and works printed first in a series of
articles in a periodical, but intended to be published as books, may
have the benefit of this interim copyright. If a copyright work
becomes out of print, the owner may be notified of the act through
the minister of agriculture, who, if he does not apply a remedy,
may license a new edition, subject to a royalty to the owner.
Anonymous books may be entered in the name of the first
publisher. In 1889 an amending Canadian act was passed, which
led to a long controversy with the Mother Country,—the imperial
government refusing to sanction it,—till in 1900 a compromise
was effected, and a further act amending that of 1886 became
law. It applies only to books copyright in Canada, and, subject
to certain reservations, allows the minister of agriculture to
prohibit the importation, without consent of the licensees, of any
copies printed elsewhere of books published in the British
dominions licensed by the owners to be reproduced in Canada.
</p><p>The Australian states all have copyright laws modelled on
the English. New Zealand provides for a term of 28 years, or
the author’s life. In Cape Colony the term for books is the
author’s life and 5 years, or a minimum of 30 years. The Indian
act of 1847 is modelled on the English.

of American copyright.
</p><p><i>Austria</i>, by a law of 1895, gives copyright for thirty years
after author’s death.
</p><p><i>Belgium.</i>—Copyright formerly perpetual, now limited to the
life of the author, and 50 years thereafter.
</p><p><i>France.</i>—Copyright in France is recognized in the most
ample manner. Two distinct rights are secured by law—1st,
the right of reproduction of literary works, musical compositions,
and works of art; and 2nd, the right of representation
of dramatic works and musical compositions. The period
is for the life of the author and fifty years after his death.
After the author’s death the surviving consort has the usufructuary
enjoyment of the rights which the author has not
disposed of in his lifetime or by will, subject to reduction for the
benefit of the author’s protected heirs if any. The author may
dispose of his rights in the most absolute manner in the forms
and within the limits of the Code Napoléon. Piracy is a crime
punishable by fine of not less than 100 nor more than 2000 francs;
in the case of a seller from 25 to 500 francs. The pirated edition
will be confiscated. Piracy also forms the ground for a civil
action of damages to the amount of the injury sustained—the
produce of the confiscation, if any, to go towards payment of
the indemnity (Penal Code, Art. 425–429).
</p><p><i>Germany.</i>—Period fixed in 1837 at ten years; but copyright
for longer periods was granted for voluminous and costly works,
and for the works of German poets. Among others the works
of Schiller, Goethe, Wieland, &amp;c., were protected for a period of
twenty years from the date of the decree in each case. In 1845
the period was extended in all cases to the author’s life and
thirty years after. The present law rests on a Codifying Act of
1901, the term being the author’s life and 30 years, or not less
than 10 years in any case.
</p><p><i>Greece.</i>—Copyright is for fifteen years from publication.
</p><p><i>Holland.</i>—Fifty years, or author’s life, whichever is longer.
</p><p><i>Hungary.</i>—by a law of 1884, gives a copyright for the author’s
life and 50 years after.
</p><p><i>Italy.</i>—Life of author, or 40 years from date of publication;
and afterwards a further period of 40 years, subject to a right
in others to reproduce on payment of 5% on each copy.
</p><p><i>Japan.</i>—Author’s life and 30 years after.

<i>Norway</i>, by a law of 1893, gives protection for author’s life
and 50 years after.

</p><p><i>Russia.</i>—Author’s life and 50 years.

</p><p><i>Turkey.</i>—Author’s life, or 40 years, whichever is the longer.
</p><p>17. <i>United States.</i>—American copyright is provided for by
an act of March 1909, which replaced acts of July 1870 and
March 1891, both of which had introduced important
modifications in the original act of 1790. Under all
<span style="text-align: left; width: 6em; float: left; padding: 0.4em 0.8em 0.4em 0em; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; font-size: 85%; line-height: 1.3em;">American law.</span>
acts preceding that of 1891, copyright had been granted
to “citizens or residents of the United States,” the term
“resident” having been, in decisions prior to 1891, construed
to mean a person domiciled in the United States with the
intention of making there his permanent abode. The works
of foreigners could thus be reproduced without authorization,
and they were so reproduced in so far as there was prospect of
financial gain. The leading publishers, however, had from the
earliest times made terms with British authors, or with their
representatives, the British publishers, for producing authorized
American editions. But at most they were only able to secure
by this means an advantage of a few weeks’ priority over the
unauthorized editions, and the good-will of the conscientious
buyer; so that if they paid the author any considerable sum,
the price of the authorized editions had to be made so high that
it was not easy to secure a remunerative sale. The unauthorized
editions had the further advantage in competition, that for the
purpose of being manufactured more promptly and more
economically, they could be and often were issued in an abbreviated
and garbled form, an injury which to not a few writers
seemed more grievous than the lack of pecuniary profit. In
Great Britain, during the first half of the 19th century, the copyright
law had been so interpreted as to secure recognition of the
rights of American authors for such works as were produced
there not later than in any other country, so that authors like
<a href="/wiki/Author:Washington_Irving" title="Author:Washington Irving">Washington Irving</a> and <a href="/wiki/Author:James_Fenimore_Cooper" title="Author:James Fenimore Cooper">Fenimore Cooper</a> secured for a time
satisfactory returns; but after 1850 the conditions became the
same as in the United States. Unauthorized editions were
published, and were often incomplete and garbled.
</p><p>As from decade to decade the books produced on either side
of the Atlantic, which possessed interest for readers of the other
side, increased in quantity and in importance, the evil of these
unrestricted piracies increased. The injury to British authors
was greater only in proportion as the English books were more
numerous. The pressure from Great Britain during the last
half of the 19th century for international copyright was continuous;
and in America it was recognized by authors, by
representative publishers, and by the more intelligent people
everywhere, that the existing conditions were of material
disadvantage. The loss to American authors was direct; and
the loss to legitimate American publishers was also clear, in that
better returns could be secured by adequate payments for
rights that could be protected by law than by “courtesy”
payments for authorizations that carried no legal rights. An
injury was being done to American literature; for, when
authorized editions of American works had to compete against
unauthorized and more cheaply produced editions of English
works, the business incentive for literary production was seriously
lessened. In fiction particularly, authors had to contend against
a flood of cheaply produced editions of “appropriated” English
books. Equally to be condemned were the ethics of a relation
under which one class of property could be appropriated while
other classes secured legal protection. On these several grounds
efforts had long been made to secure international copyright.
Between 1843 and 1886 no less than eleven international copyright
bills were drafted, for the most part at the instance of the
copyright associations or copyright leagues. They were one
after the other killed in committee. In 1886 the twelfth international
copyright bill was brought before the Senate by Senator
Jonathan Chace of Rhode Island, and was referred to the
committee on patents. In 1887 the American Publishers’
Copyright League (succeeding the earlier American Publishers’
Association) was organized, with William H. Appleton as
president and G. H. Putnam as secretary. The executive
committee of this league formed, with a similar committee of
the Author’s Copyright League, a conference committee, under
the direction of which the campaign for copyright was continued
until the passage of the act of March 1891. Of the Authors’
Copyright League James Russell Lowell was the first president,
being succeeded by Edmund Clarence Stedman. The secretary
during the active work of the league was Robert U. Johnson.
Under the initiative of the conference committee copyright
leagues were organized in Boston, Chicago, St Louis, Cincinnati,
Minneapolis, Denver, Colorado City and other places. The
Chace Bill was introduced in the House in March 1888. In
May 1890 this bill, with certain modifications, came before the
House, and was there defeated. In March 1891 the same
measure, with certain further modifications, secured a favourable
vote in the House during the last hour of the last day of the
session, was passed by the Senate, and was promptly signed
by President Harrison. Thus, after a struggle extending over
fifty-three years, the United States accepted the principle at
all events of international copyright.
</p><p>18. The act of 1891 was criticized in several respects: (1)
A condition was that books or works of art must be “manufactured”
in America; consideration not being given to books
originally produced in some language other than English. (2)
It required publication in the United States simultaneously with
that in the country of origin. (3) The term of copyright (28
years, with an extension of 14 years to the author if alive, or to
widow or children) was shorter than that accorded under the law
of any other literature-producing country, excepting Greece.
Minor amending acts were passed in 1893, 1895 and 1897, that
of Feb. 19, 1897, establishing as the copyright department of
the library of Congress a Bureau of Copyrights, the head of which
bears the title of <a href="/w/index.php?title=Register_of_Copyrights&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Register of Copyrights (page does not exist)">Register of Copyrights</a>. Eventually, after hard

and the Publishers’ Copyright League, and after
sittings extending to a period of three years, a new bill
submitted to Congress by the two Committees on
Patents of the House of Representatives and the Senate was
successfully passed. It came into force on the 1st of July 1909.
Its provisions may be briefly summarized as follows:—
</p>
<div style="font-size: 92%; line-height: 1.3em">
<p>Copyright is granted to authors for twenty-eight years from the
date of first publication, whether the copyrighted work bears the
author’s true name or is published anonymously or under
an assumed name. A further term of twenty-eight years
<span style="text-align: left; width: 6em; float: left; padding: 0.4em 0.8em 0.4em 0em; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; font-size: 85%; line-height: 1.3em;">Term of copyright.</span>
is granted to the author if at the expiration of the first
term he be still living, or to his widow and children if he be dead.
If the author’s widow and children be dead an extension is granted
to the author’s executors, or in the absence of a will, to his next of
kin. Applications for renewal and extension must be made to the
copyright office and duly registered therein within one year prior
to the expiration of the existing term. To any work in which
copyright subsists at the time the act went into force the act extends
renewal for a period of twenty-eight years at the expiration of the
time provided for under the previously existing law (first period
28 years, renewal period 14 years). The works for which copyright
may be secured under the act “Shall include all the writings of an
author.” For purposes of registration the act classifies (1) books,
<span style="text-align: left; width: 6em; float: left; padding: 0.4em 0.8em 0.4em 0em; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; font-size: 85%; line-height: 1.3em;">Definition of copyright.</span>including composite and cyclopaedic works, directories,
gazetteers and other compilations; (2) periodicals, including
newspapers; (3) lectures, sermons, addresses, prepared
for oral delivery; (4) dramatic or dramatico-musical
compositions; (5) musical compositions; (6) maps; (7)
works of art; models or designs for works of art; (8) reproductions
of a work of art; (9) drawings or plastic works of a scientific or
technical character; (10) photographs and (11) prints and pictorial
illustrations. But compilations or abridgments, adaptations,
arrangements, dramatizations, translations or other versions of
copyrighted works, when produced with the consent of the proprietors
of the copyrighted work are, under the 1909 act, new works subject
to copyright. A citizen or subject of a foreign state can secure
copyright only when he is domiciled within the United States at the
time of the first publication of his work, or when the foreign state
or nation of which he is a subject grants, either by treaty, convention,
agreement or law, to citizens of the United States the benefit of&#32;<span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="125" data-page-number="125" title="Page:EB1911_-_Volume_07.djvu/142">&#8203;</span></span>copyright on substantially the same basis as to its own citizens, or
copyright protection equal to that secured by the foreign author
under the United States act, or when the foreign state is a party to
an international agreement providing for reciprocity in the granting
of copyright, and the United States may, by the terms of that
agreement, become a party thereto. After copyright has been
secured by publication of a work, two complete copies of the best
edition published must be “promptly” deposited in the copyright
office, or mailed to the register of copyrights, the postmaster, on
request, giving a receipt and mailing the books without cost. If the
work be a contribution to a periodical, one copy of the issue containing
it must be sent, or if it be a work not reproduced in copies for
sale, a copy, print, photograph or other identifying reproduction
must accompany the claim. Prior to 1891 the works of authors
could be put into print on either side of the Atlantic. The act of
1891 laid down that, in order to secure copyright, all editions of the
works of all authors, resident or non-resident, must be entirely
<span style="text-align: left; width: 6em; float: left; padding: 0.4em 0.8em 0.4em 0em; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; font-size: 85%; line-height: 1.3em;">“Manu-<br />facture” clause.</span>manufactured within the United States, the term “manufactured”
including the setting of type as well as printing
and binding. This manufacturing condition was insisted
on by the typographical unions. There is no logical
connexion, however, between the right of an author or artist to the
control of his production and the interests of American workmen;
the attempt to legislate for them jointly must bring about no little
confusion and inequity. If American working-men cannot secure a
living in competition with labourers on the other side of the Atlantic,
their needs should be cared for under the provisions of the protective
tariff. It is, however, the belief of a large number of those who are
engaged in the manufacturing of books that, with his advanced
methods of work, the skilled American labourer has no reason to
dread the competition of European craftsmen. With this manufacturing
condition out of the way, there would be nothing to
prevent the United States from becoming a party to the Bern
Convention. This would place intellectual property on both sides
of the Atlantic on the same footing. The power of the unions was
sufficiently strong to prevent this condition being eliminated from
the act of 1909, but the just claims were met of authors whose books
are originally produced in some language other than English, the
<span style="text-align: left; width: 6em; float: left; padding: 0.4em 0.8em 0.4em 0em; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; font-size: 85%; line-height: 1.3em;">Exemption of text of foreign book.</span>“original text of a book of foreign origin in a language or
languages other than English” being exempted
from
the
requirements as to type-setting in the United States. On
the other hand the manufacturing condition is extended by
the act of 1909 to illustrations within a book, and also to
separate lithographs or photo-engravings, “except where in either
case the subjects represented are located in a foreign country and
illustrate a scientific work or reproduce a work of art.” The notice
of copyrights required by the act consists either of the word “copyright”
or by the abbreviation “Copr.,” accompanied by the name
of the copyright proprietor, and in the case of printed literary,
musical or dramatic works, the notice must include also the year in
which the copyright was secured by publication. In the case of
works specified in 6 to 11 inclusive, of the classification given above,
the copyright notice may consist of the letter C enclosed within a
circle, thus: <span style="font-size: 144%;">©</span>, accompanied by the initials, monogram, mark or
symbol of the copyright proprietor, provided that on some accessible
portion of the copy or of the margin, or on the back or pedestal his
name appears.

of the copyright, or the copyright may be bequeathed by

be acknowledged by the assignor before a consular officer of the
United States. Every assignment of copyright must be recorded

in the United States or within six months without the limits of

or to free public libraries, when importation is for use and not for

<p>The provisions having to do with international copyright
become operative in the case of a foreign state only when the
president proclaims that the state has fulfilled the condition of
reciprocity. The act of 1891 was put into force with foreign
states as follows:—1st of July 1891, Great Britain, Belgium,
France, Switzerland; 8th of March 1892, Germany (by separate
treaty); 31st of October 1892, Italy; 8th of May 1893, Denmark;
15th of July 1895, Spain; 20th of July 1895, Portugal; 27th of
February 1896, Mexico; 13th of April 1896, Sweden and Norway;
25th of May 1896, Chile; 19th of October 1899, Costa Rica; 20th
of November 1899, the kingdom of the Netherlands. In the case
of each state the territory covered by the provisions of the law
included the possessions, dependencies, &amp;c. The copyright agreement
with Great Britain therefore covered the crown colonies
of the empire, including India and the self-governing dominions
and states, such as Canada, Australia, &amp;c. An American work
duly entered for copyright in Great Britain secures, as a British
publication secures, the protection of copyright under the
provisions of the Bern convention throughout the territory of
the several states that are parties to that convention.

much earlier than artists for their artistic productions. Pictures
and illustrations, when included in books or newspapers, are
protected by the law which applies to the latter, but that is a
separate question. It was not until the reign of George II. that
the legislature in England afforded any protection for the work
of artists. The English law on artistic copyright is alone considered
in this account, the American having been included in the
section <i>United States</i> above (18), while for other countries the
details are so various that it is only possible to refer the reader
to the leading text-books.
</p><p>The first Artists’ Copyright Bill was passed in the interest
of William Hogarth, one of the greatest of English painters,
who was engraver as well as painter, and who devoted
a considerable portion of his time to engraving his
<span style="text-align: left; width: 6em; float: left; padding: 0.4em 0.8em 0.4em 0em; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; font-size: 85%; line-height: 1.3em;">Engravings.</span>own works. No sooner, however, were these published
than his market was seriously damaged by the issue of inferior
copies of his engravings by other publishers. To protect Hogarth
from such piracy the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Engraving_Copyright_Act_1734&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Engraving Copyright Act 1734 (page does not exist)">Engraving Copyright Act 1734</a> was passed,
which provided that “every person who should invent and
design, engrave, etch, or work in mezzotinto or chiaroscuro, any
historical or other print or prints, should have the sole right and
&#32;<span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="126" data-page-number="126" title="Page:EB1911_-_Volume_07.djvu/143">&#8203;</span></span>
liberty of printing and representing the same for the term of
fourteen years, to commence from the day of the first publishing
thereof, which shall be truly engraved with the name of the proprietor
on each plate, and printed on every such print or prints.”
The penalty for piracy was the forfeiture of the plate and all
prints, with a fine of 5s. for every pirated print.
</p><p>In 1766, in the reign of George III., a second Engraving
Copyright Act was passed “to amend and render more effectual”
the first act, and “for vesting and securing to Jane Hogarth,
widow, the property in certain prints,” which extended the
protection beyond the designer, who was also engraver, to any
person who, not being himself a designer, made, or caused to
be made, an engraving from any picture or other work of art.
Jane Hogarth, the widow of the painter, found herself nearing
the termination of the fourteen years’ term of copyright grant
by the first act, with the probability that immediately on its
expiry the engravings of her husband then on sale, and on which
her livelihood depended, would be immediately pirated. It
was mainly to save her from the loss of her livelihood that this
second Copyright Bill extended the term of the copyright to
twenty-eight years.
</p><p>The engravers and publishers of the day were not over-scrupulous,
and they sought to evade the penalties of the copyright
acts by taking the designs, and adding to them or taking
from them, or both, and producing fresh engravings, seeking to
make it appear that they were producing new works. These practices
assumed such proportions that it became necessary, in 1777,
to call upon parliament to put through another short measure
still further to protect the engraver, by prohibiting the copying
“in whole or in part” (a clause not contained in the previous
acts), by varying, adding to, or diminishing from, the main design
of an engraving without the express consent of the proprietor or
proprietors. These three acts remain in force to the present day.
In 1852, in an international copyright act, it was declared that the
Engraving Copyright Acts collectively were intended to include
prints taken by lithography or any other mechanical process.
</p><p>20. In May 1814 the Sculpture Copyright Act was passed to
give protection to sculptors. The term of copyright for sculptors
was a peculiar one. It was to last for fourteen years,
with the proviso that, should the author be still alive,
<span style="text-align: left; width: 6em; float: left; padding: 0.4em 0.8em 0.4em 0em; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; font-size: 85%; line-height: 1.3em;">Sculpture.</span>
he should enjoy a further period of fourteen years, the copyright
returning to him for the second fourteen should he have disposed
of it for the first period. It is a condition of copyright with
the sculptor that the author must put his name with the date
upon every work before putting it forth or publishing it. A
curious and interesting point in the interpretation of this act is,
that according to the opinion of eminent jurists it is necessary to
an infringement of the copyright of a piece of sculpture that the
copy of it must take the form of another piece of sculpture;
that a photograph, drawing, or engraving of a piece of sculpture
is not to be considered a reproduction of it, and is therefore
not an infringement of the sculptor’s copyright.
</p><p>21. Strange as it may seem, painting was the last branch of
the arts to receive copyright protection. The cause of the
painters was taken up by the Society of Arts, who
endeavoured, in the first instance, to pass an amendment
<span style="text-align: left; width: 6em; float: left; padding: 0.4em 0.8em 0.4em 0em; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; font-size: 85%; line-height: 1.3em;">Painting.</span>
and consolidation bill dealing with engraving, sculpture and
painting; but, failing in their first effort, they limited their
second to an attempt to pass a bill in favour of painting, drawing
and photography. It was in the year 1862 that this act, having
passed through parliament, came into force. The absence of
any antecedent protection for the painter is clearly stated in
its preamble, which reads as follows: “Whereas by law as now
established, the authors of paintings, drawings, and photographs
have no copyright in such their works, and it is expectant that
the law should in that respect be amended. Be it, therefore,
enacted,” &amp;c. This preamble makes it clear that there is no
copyright in any paintings, drawings, or photographs executed
and dealt with before the year 1862—to be exact, 29th July of
that year. The duration of the term of copyright in this act of
1862 differs from its predecessors, by being made dependent on
the life of the author, to which life seven years were added. In
the Literary Copyright Act there are two terms—the life of the
author and seven years, or forty-two years, whichever may
prove the longer. In taking a fixed term like forty-two years
it is necessary to have something to start from, and with a
literary work it was easy to start from the date of publication.
But pictures are not published. They may pass from the studio
to the wall of the purchaser without being made public in any
way. The difficulty was evidently before the author of this act,
and the artist’s term was made his life and seven years after his
death without any alternative. This term applies equally to
photographers. Perhaps no bill which ever passed through
parliament ostensibly for the purpose of benefiting a certain set
of people has failed so completely as has this bill to accomplish
its end. It started by proposing to give copyright to authors
of paintings, drawings and photographs, and it would seem that
no difficulty ought to have arisen as to whom such copyright
should rightly belong; but the following clause of the act has
introduced confusion into the question of ownership:—
</p>
<div style="font-size: 92%; line-height: 1.3em">
<p>Provided that when any painting, or drawing, or the negative
of any photograph, shall for the first time after the passing of
this act be sold or disposed of, or shall be made or executed for
or on behalf of any other person for a good or valuable consideration,
the person so selling or disposing of, or making or executing
the same, shall not retain the copyright thereof unless it be expressly
reserved to him by agreement in writing, signed at or before the
time of such sale or disposition, by the vendee or assignee of such
painting or drawing, or such negative of a photograph, or by the
person on whose behalf the same shall be so made or executed;
but the copyright shall belong to the vendee or assignee of such
painting or drawing, or such negative of a photograph, or to the
person for or on whose behalf the same shall have been made or
executed; nor shall the vendee or assignee thereof be entitled to such
copyright unless at or before the time of such sale or disposition an
agreement in writing, signed by the person so selling or disposing of
the same, or by his agent duly authorized, shall have been made to
that effect.
</p>
</div>
<p>That is to say, after promising the author copyright in his work
for life and seven years, the act stipulates that in order to get it
the author must, at the time of the first sale or disposition of his
picture, obtain a document in writing from the purchaser of the
picture, reserving the copyright to the author, and the act goes
on to say that if he does not take this step the copyright becomes
the property of the purchaser of the picture, but with the
proviso, in order to secure it to him, he must have a document
signed by the artist assigning the copyright to him; but if neither
of these things is done, and no document is signed, the copyright
does not belong to either the artist who sells or the client who
buys, and the act is silent as to whom it does belong to. It has
disappeared and belongs to no one. There is no copyright existing
in the work for any one. It has passed into the public domain,
and any one who can get access to the work may reproduce it.
Now, as most purchases are made from the walls of exhibitions,
in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred the copyright is absolutely
lost. And where the sale is arranged directly between the artist
and his client, the difficulty experienced by the artist in raising
the question as to whom the copyright shall belong to is so great,
owing to the dread lest the mere mention of the signing of a
document should cause the selling of the picture to fall through,
that in numerous such cases the copyright lapses and becomes
public property. Photographers are not affected by this clause,
because they do not as a rule sell the negatives they produce, and
with them the copyright lies in the negative. They carry on their
trade in prints without the question of the negative arising.
The picture-dealer, also, who buys a picture and copyright is
not subjected to the same disability as the painter. The picture-dealer
can sell a picture without saying a word to his client as
to the copyright, which he, nevertheless, retains intact; the
provision is applicable only to the <i>first</i> sale of the work, which,
therefore, throws the whole of the disability upon the painter.
</p><p>The act gives the copyright of every work executed on commission
to the person by whom it is commissioned. It makes
it compulsory upon every owner of a copyright that he should
register it at Stationers’ Hall before he can take any action at
law to protect it. The copyright does not lapse if unregistered,
but so long as it remains unregistered no action at law can be&#32;<span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="127" data-page-number="127" title="Page:EB1911_-_Volume_07.djvu/144">&#8203;</span></span>
taken on account of any infringement. A copyright can be
registered at any time, even after an infringement, but the owner
of the copyright cannot recover for any infringement before
registration. The act provides for both penalties and damages
in the following cases:—(1) For infringing copyright in the
ordinary way by issuing unlawful copies. (2) For fraudulently
signing or affixing a fraudulent signature to a work of art. (3)
For fraudulently dealing with a work so signed. (4) For fraudulently
putting forth a copy of a work of art, whether there be
copyright in it or no, as the original work of the artist. (5) For
altering, adding to, or taking away from a work during the
lifetime of the author if it is signed, and putting it forth as the
unaltered work of the author. (6) For importing pirated works.
</p>
<div style="font-size: 92%; line-height: 1.3em">
<p>The incongruities of this act were so apparent that its promoters
desired to stop it, feeling that it would be better to have no bill at all
than one which conferred so little upon the people it was intended to
benefit; but Lord Westbury, the lord chancellor, who had charge of
the bill in the House of Lords, advised them to let it go through with
all its imperfections, that they might get the right of the painter to
protection recognized. This advice was followed, and the bill had no
sooner become law than a fresh effort was started to have it amended.
Year by year the agitation went on, with the exception only of a
period when Irish affairs took up all the attention of parliament, and
domestic legislation was rendered impossible. But in 1898 the
Copyright Association of Great Britain promoted a bill, which
was introduced into the House of Lords by Lord Herschell. It
was a measure designed to deal with all forms of copyright—literary,
musical, dramatic and artistic—and was remitted by the House of
Lords for consideration to a committee, which, having sat for three
sessions, decided not to proceed with Lord Herschell’s measure,
but to treat literature and art in separate bills. It had under its
consideration an artistic bill, drafted for and presented by the Royal
Academy, and a literary bill and an artistic bill drafted by the
committee itself. The main proposals in the latter were to give
copyright to the author of any artistic work or photograph for a
period of life and thirty years, unless the work be commissioned,
in which case the copyright was to be the property of the employer,
except in the case of sculpture intended to be placed in a street or
public place. The bill provided summary remedies for dealing with
pirated works. It omitted altogether any reference to registration,
and it provided for international copyright.
</p>
</div>
<p>22. To sum up the position of artistic copyright in 1909, we
find five British acts, three dealing with engraving, one with
sculpture, and one with painting, drawing and photography,
and between them very little relation. We have three terms of
duration of copyright—28 years for engraving, 14 for sculpture,
with a second 14 if the artist be alive at the end of the first, life
and 7 years for painting, drawing or photography. There are
two different relations of the artist to his copyright. The
sculptor’s right to sell his work and retain his copyright has
never been questioned so long as he signs and dates it. The
painter’s copyright is made to depend upon the signing of a
document by the purchaser of his work. The engraver and the
sculptor are not required to register; but the author’s name,
and the date of putting forth or publishing, must appear on his
work. The painter cannot protect his copyright without
registration, but this registration as it is now required is merely
a pitfall for the unwary. Designed to give the public information
as to the ownership and duration of copyrights, the uncertainty
of its operation results in the prevention of information on these
very points.
</p><p>The Berlin Convention of 1908 led to the appointment of a
British committee to deal with its recommendations, and their
report in 1909 foreshadowed important changes in the law both
of literary and of artistic copyright, whenever Parliament
should give its attention seriously to the subject.
</p><p>Difficult and complicated as is the whole subject of artistic
copyright, it is perhaps not to be wondered at that ignorance
of the law on the subject is very widespread, even
amongst those who are most interested in its action.<span style="text-align: left; width: 6em; float: left; padding: 0.4em 0.8em 0.4em 0em; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; font-size: 85%; line-height: 1.3em;">Practical difficulties.</span>
One of the commonest beliefs amongst artists is, that
all they have to do to secure copyright is to register a
picture at Stationers’ Hall; but the authorities at Stationers’
Hall ask no questions, and simply enter any particulars submitted
to them on their printed form. Some artists make a practice,
when they send a picture away to exhibition, to fill up one of these
forms, reserving the copyright by their entry to themselves, in
the belief that, if accompanied by the fee required by the
Hall, its entry will reserve the copyright to them, oblivious of the
fact that the only thing which can reserve the copyright to them
is the possession of a document assigning the copyright to them
by the purchaser of the picture. Another useless method of
attempting to reserve artists’ copyrights is that adopted by
the promoters of public exhibitions, with whom it is an almost
constant practice to print on some portion of the catalogue
of the exhibition a statement that “copyrights of all pictures
are reserved,” the impression apparently prevailing that a notice
of this kind effectively reserves the copyright for the artist while
selling his picture from the walls. It, of course, does no such
thing, and the copyright of any picture sold in these circumstances,
without the necessary document from the purchaser,
must be lost to the artist, and pass irrevocably into the public
domain.
</p><p>In a work of art the work itself and the copyright are two totally
distinct properties, and may be held by different persons. The
conditions differ materially from those of a work of literature, in
which as a rule there is no value apart from publication. There is
a value in a work of art for its private enjoyment quite apart
from its commercial value in the form of reproductions; but
when the two properties exist in different hands, the person
holding the copyright has no power to force the owner of the work
of art to give him access to it for purposes of reproduction;
this can only be effected by private arrangement. It has been
argued that, as the two properties are so distinct, the owner of the
copyright ought to have the right of access to the picture for the
purpose of exercising his right to reproduce it. But it is easy to
see that it would destroy the value of art property if proprietors
knew that at any moment they might be forced to surrender
their work for the purpose of reproduction, though for a time
only.
</p><p>There is often a strong sympathy between the artist and the
person who buys his picture, and it is not at all unusual, when
application is made to the owner of the picture for access to it,
for him to submit the question of reproduction to the artist.
Although the latter may really have no right in it, it is felt, as
a practical matter, that he is largely interested in the character
of the reproduction it is proposed to make. Hence the courtesy
which is usually extended to him.
</p><p>Owing also to the increased facilities of reproduction, the
practice has become very common of splitting up copyrights and
granting licences in what may be described as very minute forms.
It would, of course, be impossible for a publisher to pay an artist
the sum at which he values his entire copyright, simply that he
might reproduce his picture in the form of a black-and-white
block in a magazine, and it has consequently become quite
common for the artist to grant a licence for any and every
particular form of reproduction as it may be required, so that
he may grant the right of reproduction in one particular form
in one particular publication, and even for a particular period
of time, reserving to himself thus the right to grant similar
licences to other publishers. This is apparently not to the injury
of the artist; it is probably to his advantage, and it certainly
promotes business.
</p><p>23. The great obstacle in the way of securing a really good
Artistic Bill has been the introduction into it of photography.
It was by a sort of accident that the photographer was
given the same privileges as the painter in the bill of<span style="text-align: left; width: 6em; float: left; padding: 0.4em 0.8em 0.4em 0em; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; font-size: 85%; line-height: 1.3em;">Photo-<br />graphs.</span>
1862. The promoters of the bill thought that the
photographer would be protected by the Engraving Acts which
covered prints; but since the photographers feared that, as
their prints were of a different character from the prints from a
plate, the Engraving Acts might not protect them, it was at the
last moment decided to put photography into the Art Bill. The
result of this was that the painter lost his chance of copyright on
all works executed on commission. Legislators feared that if
photographers held copyright in all their works the public would
have no protection from the annoyance of seeing the photographs
of their wives and daughters exhibited and sold in shop windows
by the side of “professional beauties” and other people, and&#32;<span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="128" data-page-number="128" title="Page:EB1911_-_Volume_07.djvu/145">&#8203;</span></span>made articles of commerce. So in the case of commissioned works
the copyright was denied to both painters and photographers.
</p><p>The royal commission which reported on the subject in 1878
proposed two distinct terms of copyright for painting and
photography. The term for the painter was dependent on his
life; that for the photographer was a definitely fixed term of
years from the date of publication of his photographs; and there
can be little doubt that this is the right way to deal with the two
branches of copyright. The artist who paints a picture signs it,
and there is no difficulty in knowing who is the author of a painting
and in whom the term of copyright is vested. In a very large
number of cases a photograph is taken by an employee, who is
here to-day and gone to-morrow, and even his employer knows
nothing of his existence. Of course, it may suit an employer to be
able to maintain secrecy as to the authorship of his negative,
inasmuch as it enables him to go on claiming copyright fees
indefinitely; but it is not to the public interest. In most
countries on the continent of Europe a photographer has the fixed
term of five years’ copyright in an original photograph dating
from its publication, which date, together with the name and
address of the photographer, has to be stamped on every copy
issued. In the public interest this is a good method of dealing
with photographs.
</p><p>24. The “authorship” of a photograph has been much
debated in the law courts; and “author” was defined in
<i>Nollage</i> v. <i>Jackson</i> (1883) as “the man who really represents or
creates, or gives to ideas, or fancy, or imagination, true local
habitation—the man in fact who is most nearly the effective
cause of the representation” (<i>per</i> Lord Justice Bowen). He is not
necessarily the owner of the camera, or the proprietor of the business;
it depends on the circumstances. He is essentially the
person who groups and effectively superintends the picture. When
a photographer takes a portrait without fee, the copyright vests
in him and not in the sitter, who cannot prevent its publication;
but if the photograph is commissioned and paid for by the sitter
the copyright—in the absence of contrary stipulations—vests
in him, and he can restrain exhibition or multiplication of copies;
“the bargain includes, by implication, an agreement that the
prints taken from the negative are to be appropriated to the use
of the customer only” (Mr Justice North in <i>Pollard</i> v. <i>Photographic</i>
<i>Co.</i>, 1888). And this applies even when the sitter is not
the actual purchaser of the negative (<i>Boucas</i> v. <i>Cooke</i>, 1903).
But in several cases the “celebrity” who has <i>sat</i> to a photographer
at his request and without payment has not been allowed
to distribute his photograph to newspapers for reproduction without
the photographer’s consent. The fact that a sitter pays the
photographer for prints, though he has not commissioned the
sitting, would not vest the copyright in him.
</p><p>25. The “Living Pictures” case in 1894 (<i>Hanfstängel</i> v.
<i>Empire Palace</i>) was a curious one. The Empire music-hall in
London produced some <i>tableaux vivants</i>, representing certain
pictures, of which Messrs Hanfstängel owned the copyright,
and an action was brought by them for an injunction. The
courts of chancery and of appeal decided against the plaintiffs, on
the ground that a reproduction of a painting must be by a
painting or something cognate; but in an action for infringement,
though the view already given was confirmed, the plaintiffs
succeeded so far as the backgrounds to the grouping were
concerned. Meanwhile two newspapers had published sketches
of the same <i>tableaux vivants</i>, and Messrs Hanfstängel brought
actions for infringement (<i>Hanfstängel</i> v. <i>Newnes</i>, and v. <i>Baines</i>,
1894). Mr Justice Stirling found for the plaintiffs, but on appeal,
and finally in the House of Lords, this decision was reversed.
</p><p>26. <i>Copyright in Designs.</i>—An act of 1787 first gave protection
to printed designs on linen and cotton fabrics; and in 1839
a further act included designs on animal fabrics, or
mixed animal and vegetable fabrics; while in the same
<span style="text-align: left; width: 6em; float: left; padding: 0.4em 0.8em 0.4em 0em; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; font-size: 85%; line-height: 1.3em;">Designs.</span>
year another act protected designs for manufactured articles.
These acts had been preceded in France by laws of 1737 and
1744 creating a property by law in manufacturers’ designs. The
British law, which in various acts established a copyright (a) in
ornamental and (b) useful designs, was in 1883 consolidated in the
Patents, Designs and Trade Marks Act, with amending acts up to
1888; and these acts were further consolidated and amended by
an act of 1905.

<p><span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="128" data-page-number="128" title="Page:EB1911_-_Volume_07.djvu/145">&#8203;</span></span>The consolidation of the British copyright law, not only in the
United Kingdom but in the Dominions, and its amendment so
as to include the recommendations of the Berlin International
Convention of 1908, were the objects of a government bill
introduced into parliament by the president of the Board of
Trade on the 26th of July 1910, discussion on which was reserved
for a later period in the year. The passing of this bill, though
the date of it was uncertain owing to the peculiar circumstances
of English politics at the moment, was practically assured by
the facts that, apart altogether from the crying need for a revision
of the English law, the draft had previously been considered
and accepted, not only by a Board of Trade Committee which
reported unanimously in favour of the recommendations of the
Berlin Convention, but also by an Imperial Conference. The
bill for the first time brought British copyright entirely under
statutory law and consolidated and amended all previous
enactments; it adopted the suggestions of the Imperial Conference
(attended by representatives of Canada, Australia, South
Africa, New Zealand and Newfoundland, other interests being
covered by home representatives of the Foreign Office, India
Office, Colonial Office and Board of Trade) as to providing for
its extension by their declaration to the Dominions; and with its
enactment a great simplification of the British law of copyright
came in sight, though for historical reasons the details given
above of the law as unamended must still remain of value.
</p><p>Briefly, the new points of importance, apart from the placing
of all copyright on a purely statutory basis and the inclusion
of literary and artistic copyright within one arrangement, were
as follows. All compulsory formalities of registration were
abolished. The length of the period for which copyright lasted
was extended to the life of the author and 50 years after. This
reform was qualified, however, by a clause intended to protect
the public from its abuse, and providing that after the author’s
death, if the work was withheld from the public or published
at too high a price, or if the reasonable requirements of the
public were not satisfied, a licence might be granted to publish
or perform it. These changes applied to all the subject-matters of
copyright, which were now put on the same level and treated
uniformly. In certain cases, already discussed above, protection
was extended: <i>e.g.</i> translations and lectures, original adaptations
and arrangements, works of artistic novelty, including
architectural designs; and the right to dramatize a novel or
“novelize” a drama was conferred in each case on the author.
Musical works were protected against unauthorized reproduction
by mechanical means without payment; but protection was
also extended to the mechanical record when authorized.
</p><p>In including all sorts of intellectual product the bill followed
the recommendation (resolution 6) of the Imperial Conference
as to the definition of copyright (Parl. Paper Cd. 5272): “the
Conference is of opinion that, subject to proper qualifications,
copyright should include the sole right to produce or reproduce
a work, or any substantial part thereof, in any material form
whatsoever and in any language, to perform, or in the case of a
lecture, to deliver, the work or any substantial part thereof in
public, and, if the work is unpublished, to publish the work, and
should include the sole right to dramatize novels and vice versa,
and to make records, &amp;c., by means of which a work may be
mechanically performed.” As to architecture and artistic crafts
the Conference recommended (resolution 9) that “an original
work of art should not lose the protection of artistic copyright
solely because it consists of, or is embodied in, a work of architecture
or craftsmanship; but it should be clearly understood that
such protection is confined to its artistic form and does not extend
to the processes or methods of reproduction, or to an industrial
design capable of registration under the law relating to designs and
destined to be multiplied by way of manufacture or trade.”
</p><p>As to the application of the new period of copyright to existing
&#32;<span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="129" data-page-number="129" title="Page:EB1911_-_Volume_07.djvu/146">&#8203;</span></span>works, the Conference recommended (resolution 10) “that
existing works in which copyright actually subsists at the
commencement of the new act (but no others) should enjoy,
subject to existing rights, the same protection as future works,
but the benefit of any extension of terms should belong to the
author of the work, subject, in the case where he has assigned
his existing rights, to a power on the part of the assignee at his
option either to purchase the full benefit of the copyright during
the extended term, or, without acquiring the full copyright, to
continue to publish the work on payment of royalties, the
payment in either case to be fixed by arbitration if necessary.”
</p><p>The Conference was also of opinion (resolution 4a) that, under
the new Imperial Act, copyright should subsist only in works
of which the author was a British subject or bona fide resident
in one of the parts of the British Empire to which it extended;
and that copyright should cease if the work were first published
elsewhere than in such parts of the Empire.
</p><p>The sensible basis on which the new bill was framed, and the
authority it represented, commended it, in spite of many controversial
points, to the acceptance both of the public and of
the various parties concerned. But nobody who had ever wrestled
with all the difficulties of international copyright, as complicated
by the law in the United States, would suppose that it was the
last word on the subject. What the bill did was to bring British
legislation into better shape, and to amend it on certain points
which had worked unjustly. The great distinction between the
requirements for British and for American copyright still remained,
namely, the American manufacturing clause. Perhaps
the most notable innovation was the clause enabling a licence
to be granted for the publication of a copyright work where the
owners of the copyright had not exercised it for the “reasonable
requirements” of the public. Some such clause was clearly
called for when the period of monopoly was being extended; but
the interpretation to be put upon the occasions which would
justify such interference might well be difficult. It may perhaps
be suggested that this innovation pointed to a reconsideration
of the true relations of “publishers” and “authors” (in the
widest sense) in respect of copyright, which sooner or later might
be approached from a different point of view. The new clause
was intended for the protection of the public from the mishandling
of an author’s work after his death, while greater
protection was given him during his life. From a purely
business point of view, the question might well be whether a
publisher or other party not the author should have a copyright
at all, and whether equity would not be satisfied if copyright
vested solely in the author and his family, with liberty to any one
to “publish” on fair terms, consideration being had to an
original publisher’s reasonable claims and existing contracts.
The advisability of any such advance on the principle now
asserted must depend rather on experience of actual business
and the working of the clause; but even under the procedure
provided by the bill of 1910 it would equally be imperative for
a publisher who owned a deceased author’s copyright to show
that he had given or was giving the public valuable consideration
for his monopoly, in order to uphold it against any one willing,
on payment of a reasonable royalty, to serve the public better.
